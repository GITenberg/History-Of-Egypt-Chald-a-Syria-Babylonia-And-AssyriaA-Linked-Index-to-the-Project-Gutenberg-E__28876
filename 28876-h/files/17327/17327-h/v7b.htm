<p>
Events proved that, in this period, at any rate, the decadence of
Assyria was not due to any exhaustion of the race or impoverishment of
the country, but was mainly owing to the incapacity of its kings and the
lack of energy displayed by their generals. If Menuas and Argistis had
again and again triumphed over the Assyrians during half a century, it
was not because their bands of raw recruits were superior to the tried
veterans of Rammân-nirâri in either discipline or courage. The Assyrian
troops had lost none of their former valour, and their muster-roll
showed no trace of diminution, but their leaders had lost the power of
handling their men after the vigorous fashion of their predecessors,
and showed less foresight and tenacity in conducting their campaigns.
Although decimated and driven from fortress to fortress, and from
province to province, hampered by the rebellions it was called upon
to suppress, and distracted by civil discord, the Assyrian army still
remained a strong and efficient force, ever ready to make its full power
felt the moment it realised that it was being led by a sovereign capable
of employing its good qualities to advantage. Tiglath-pileser had,
doubtless, held a military command before ascending the throne, and
had succeeded in winning the confidence of his men: as soon as he had
assumed the leadership they regained their former prestige, and restored
to their country that supremacy which its last three rulers had failed
to maintain.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The official documents dealing with the history of
     Tiglath-pileser III. have been seriously mutilated, and
     there is on several points some difference of opinion among
     historians as to the proper order in which the fragments
     ought to be placed, and, consequently, as to the true
     sequence of the various campaigns. The principal documents
     are as follows: (1) The <i>Annals</i> in the Central Hall of the
     palace of Shalmaneser III. at Nimroud, partly defaced by
     Esarhaddon, and carried off to serve as materials for the
     south-western palace, whence they were rescued by Layard,
     and brought in fragments to the British Museum. (2) The
     <i>Tablets</i>, K. 3571 and D. T. 3, in the British Museum. (3)
     The <i>Slabs of Nimrud</i>, discovered by Layard and G. Smith.
</pre>
<p>
The empire still included the original patrimony of Assur and its
ancient colonies on the Upper Tigris, the districts of Mesopotamia won
from the Aramæans at various epochs, the cities of Khabur, Khindanu,
Laqî, and Tebabnî, and that portion of Bît-Adini which lay to the left
of the Euphrates. It thus formed a compact mass capable of successfully
resisting the fiercest attacks; but the buffer provinces which
Assur-nazir-pal and Shalmaneser III. had grouped round their own
immediate domains on the borders of Namri, of Naîri, of Melitene, and of
Syria had either resumed their independence, or else had thrown in their
lot with the states against which they had been intended to watch. The
Aramaean tribes never let slip an opportunity of encroaching on the
southern frontier. So far, the migratory instinct which had brought them
from the Arabian desert to the swamps of the Persian Gulf had met with
no check. Those who first reached its shores became the founders of that
nation of the Kaldâ which had, perhaps, already furnished Babylon with
one of its dynasties; others had soon after followed in their footsteps,
and passing beyond the Kaldâ settlement, had gradually made their way
along the canals which connect the Euphrates with the Tigris till they
had penetrated to the lowlands of the Uknu. Towards the middle of
the eighth century B.C. they wedged themselves in between Elam and
Karduniash, forming so many buffer states of varying size and influence.
They extended from north to south along both banks of the Tigris, their
different tribes being known as the Gambulu, the Puqudu, the Litau, the
Damunu, the Ruuâ, the Khindaru, the Labdudu, the Harîlu, and the Rubuu;*
the Itua, who formed the vanguard, reached the valleys of the Turnat
during the reign of Kammân-nirâri III. They were defeated in 791 B.C.,
but obstinately renewed hostilities in 783, 782, 777, and 769; favoured
by circumstances, they ended by forcing the cordon of Assyrian outposts,
and by the time of Assur-nirâri had secured a footing on the Lower Zab.
Close by, to the east of them, lay Namri and Media, both at that time in
a state of absolute anarchy. The invasions of Menuas and of Argistis
had entirely laid waste the country, and Sharduris III., the king who
succeeded Argistis, had done nothing towards permanently incorporating
them with Urartu.** Sharduris, while still heir-apparent to the throne,
had been appointed by his father governor of the recently annexed
territory belonging to Etius and the Mannai:*** he made Lununis his
headquarters, and set himself to subdue the barbarians who had settled
between the Kur and the Araxes. When he succeeded to the throne,
about 760 B.C., the enjoyment of supreme power in no way lessened
his activity. On the contrary, he at once fixed upon the sort of wide
isthmus which separates the Araxes from Lake Urumiah, as the goal of his
incursions, and overran the territory of the Babilu; there he carried by
storm three royal castles, twenty-three cities, and sixty villages; he
then fell back upon Etius, passing through Dakis, Edias, and Urmes on
his way, and brought back with him 12,735 children, 46,600 women,
12,000 men capable of bearing arms, 23,335 oxen, 58,100 sheep, and 2,500
horses; these figures give some idea of the importance of his victories
and the wealth of the conquered territory.
</p>
<pre>
     * The list of Aramæan tribes, and the positions occupied by
     them towards the middle of the eighth century, have been
     given us by Tiglath-pileser III. himself.

     ** Tiglath-pileser did not encounter any Urartian forces in
     these regions, as would almost certainly have been the case
     had these countries remained subject to Urartu from the
     invasions of Menuas and Argistis onwards.

     *** Argistis tells us in the <i>Annals</i> that he had made his
     son satrap over the provinces won from the Mannai and Etius:
     though his name is not mentioned, Sayce believes this son
     must have been Sharduris.
</pre>
<p>
So far as we can learn, he does not seem to have attacked Khubushkia,*
nor to have entered into open rivalry with Assyria; even under the rule
of Assur-nirâri III. Assyria showed a bold enough front to deter any
enemy from disturbing her except when forced to do so. Sharduris merely
strove to recover those portions of his inheritance to which Assyria
attached but little value, and his inscriptions tell us of more than
one campaign waged by him with this object against the mountaineers of
Melitene, about the year 758. He captured most of their citadels, one
after another: Dhumeskis, Zapsas, fourteen royal castles, and a hundred
towns, including Milid itself, where King Khitaruadas held his court.**
</p>
<pre>
     * It is evident from the account of the campaigns that
     Tiglath-pileser occupied Khubushkia from the very
     commencement of his reign; we must therefore assume that the
     invasions of Argistis had produced only transient effects.

     ** These campaigns must have preceded the descent into
     Syria, and I believe this latter to have been anterior to
     the expedition of Assur-nirâri against Arpad in 754 B.C.
     Assur-nirâri probably tried to reconquer the tribes who had
     just become subject to Sharduris. The descent of this latter
     into Syria probably took place about 756 or 755 B.C., and
     his wars against Melitene about 758 to 757 B.C.
</pre>
<p>
At this point two courses lay open before him. He could either continue
his march westwards, and, penetrating into Asia Minor, fall upon the
wealthy and industrious races who led a prosperous existence between
the Halys and the Sangarios, such as the Tabal, the Chalybes, and the
Phrygians, or he could turn southwards.

</pre>
<p>
Deterred, apparently, by the dreary and monotonous aspect of the Asianic
steppes, he chose the latter course; he crossed Mount Taurus, descended
into Northern Syria about 756, and forced the Khâti to swear allegiance
to him. Their inveterate hatred of the Assyrians led the Bît-Agusi to
accept without much reluctance the supremacy of the only power which had
shown itself capable of withstanding their triumphant progress. Arpad
became for several years an unfailing support to Urartu and the basis on
which its rule in Syria rested. Assur-nirâri had, as we know, at
first sought to recover it, but his attempt to do so in 754 B.C. was
unsuccessful, and merely served to demonstrate his own weakness: ten
years later, Carchemish, Grurgum, Kummukh, Samalla, Unki, Kuî&mdash;in a
word, all the Aramæans and the Khâti between the Euphrates and the
sea had followed in the steps of the Agusi, and had acknowledged the
supremacy of Sharduris.*

     * The <i>minimum</i> extent of the dominions of Sharduris in

This prince must now haye been sorely tempted to adopt, on his own
account, the policy of the Ninevite monarchs, and push on in the
direction of Hamath, Damascus, and the Phoenician seaboard, towards
those countries of Israel and Judah which were nearly coterminous with
far-off Egypt. The rapidity of the victories which he had just succeeded
in winning at the foot of Mount Taurus and Mount Amanus must have
seemed a happy omen of what awaited his enterprise in the valleys of the
Orontes and the Jordan. Although the races of southern and central
Syria had suffered less than those of the north from the ambition of the
Ninevite kings, they had, none the less, been sorely tried during the
previous century; and it might be questioned whether they had derived
courage from the humiliation of Assyria, or still remained in so feeble
a state as to present an easy prey to the first invader.
</p>
<p>
The defeat inflicted on Mari by Rammân-nirâri in 803 had done but little
harm to the prestige of Damascus. The influence exercised by this state
from the sources of the Litany to the brook of Egypt * was based on so
solid a foundation that no temporary reverse had power to weaken it.

<p>
Had the Assyrian monarch thrown himself more seriously into the
enterprise, and reappeared before the ramparts of the capital in the
following year, refusing to leave it till he had annihilated its armies
and rased its walls to the ground, then, no doubt, Israel, Judah,
the Philistines, Edom, and Ammon, seeing it fully occupied in its own
defence, might have forgotten the ruthless severity of Hazael, and have
plucked up sufficient courage to struggle against the Damascene yoke; as
it was, Bammân-nirâri did not return, and the princes who had, perhaps,
for the moment, regarded him as a possible deliverer, did not venture
on any concerted action. Joash, King of Judah, and Jehoahaz, King of
Israel, continued to pay tribute till both their deaths, within a year
of each other, Jehoahaz in 797 B.C., and Joash in 796, the first in his
bed, the second by the hand of an assassin.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Kings xii. 20, 21, xiii. 9; cf. 2 Citron, xxiv. 22-26,
     where the death of Joash is mentioned as one of the
     consequences of the Syrian invasion, and as a punishment for
     his crime in killing the sons of Jehoiada.
</pre>
<p>
Their children, Jehoash in Israel, Amaziah in Judah, were, at first, like
their parents, merely the instruments of Damascus; but before long, the
conditions being favourable, they shook off their apathy and initiated
a more vigorous policy, each in his own kingdom. Mari had been succeeded
by a certain Ben-hadad, also a son of Hazael,* and possibly this change
of kings was accompanied by one of those revolutions which had done so
much to weaken Damascus: Jehoash rebelled and defeated Ben-hadad near
Aphek and in three subsequent engagements, but he failed to make his
nation completely independent, and the territory beyond Jordan still
remained in the hands of the Syrians.** We are told that before
embarking on this venture he went to consult the aged Elisha, then on
his deathbed. He wept to see him in this extremity, and bending over
him, cried out, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the
horsemen thereof!" The prophet bade him take bow and arrows and shoot
from the window toward the East. The king did so, and Elisha said, "The
Lord's arrow of victory *** over Syria; for thou shalt smite the Syrians
in Aphek till thou have consumed them."
</p>
<pre>
     * 2 Kings xiii. 24, 25. Winckler is of opinion that Mari and
     Ben-hadad, son of Hazael, were one and the same person.

     ** 2 Kings xiii. 25, The term "saviour" in 2 Kings xiii. 5
     is generally taken as referring to Joash: Winckler, however,
     prefers to apply it to the King of Assyria. The biblical
     text does not expressly state that Joash failed to win back
     the districts of Gilead from the Syrians, but affirms that
     he took from them the cities which Hazael "had taken out of
     the hand of Jehoahaz, his father." Ramah of Gilead and the
     cities previously annexed by Jehoahaz must, therefore, have
     remained in the hands of Ben-hadad.

     *** [Heb. "salvation;" A.V. "deliverance."&mdash;Tr.]
</pre>
<p>
Then he went on: "Take the arrows," and the king took them; then he
said, "Smite upon the ground," and the king smote thrice and stayed.
And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, "Thou shouldest have
smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst
consumed it, whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice."* Amaziah,
on his side, had routed the Edomites in the Valley of Salt, one of
David's former battle-fields, and had captured their capital, Sela.**
Elated by his success, he believed himself strong enough to break the
tie of vassalage which bound him to Israel, and sent a challenge to
Jehoash in Samaria. The latter, surprised at his audacity, replied in a
parable, "The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was
in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife." But "there
passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon and trode down the thistle.
Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up:
glory thereof and abide at home; for why shouldest thou meddle to thy
hurt that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?" They met
near Beth-shemesh, on the border of the Philistine lowlands. Amaziah was
worsted in the engagement, and fell into the power of his rival. Jehoash
entered Jerusalem and dismantled its walls for a space of four hundred
cubits, "from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate;" he pillaged
the Temple, as though it had been the abode, not of Jahveh, but of some
pagan deity, insisted on receiving hostages before he would release
his prisoner, and returned to Samaria, where he soon after died (781
B.C.).***

<pre>
     * 2 Kings xiii. 14-19.

     ** 2 Kings xiv. 7; cf. 2 Gliron. xxv. 11, 12. Sela was
     rebuilt, and received the name of Joktheel from its Hebrew
     masters. The subjection of the country was complete, for,
     later on, the Hebrew chronicler tells of the conquest of
     Elath by King Azariah, son of Amaziah (2 Kings xiv. 22).

     *** 2 Kings xiv. 8-16. cf. 2 Ghron. xxv. 17-24.
</pre>
<p>
Jeroboam II. completed that rehabilitation of Israel, of which his
father had but sketched the outline; he maintained his suzerainty, first
over Amaziah, and when the latter was assassinated at Lachish (764),*
over his son, the young Azariah.** After the defeat of Ben-hadad near
Aphek, Damascus declined still further in power, and Hadrach, suddenly
emerging from obscurity, completely barred the valley of the Orontes
against it. An expedition under Shalmaneser IV. in 773 seems to have
precipitated it to a lower depth than it had ever reached before:
Jeroboam was able to wrest from it, almost without a struggle, the
cities which it had usurped in the days of Jehu, and Gilead was at last
set free from a yoke which had oppressed it for more than a century.
Tradition goes so far as to affirm that Israel reconquered the Bekaa,
Hamath, and Damascus, those northern territories once possessed by
David, and it is quite possible that its rivals, menaced from afar
by Assyria and hard pressed at their own doors by Hadrach, may have
resorted to one of those propitiatory overtures which eastern monarchs
are only too ready to recognise as acts of submission. The lesser
southern states, such as Ammon, the Bedâwin tribes of Hauran, and, at
the opposite extremity of the kingdom, the Philistines,*** who had bowed
themselves before Hazael in the days of his prosperity, now transferred
their homage to Israel.

     outcome of the events of the preceding reigns.

     *** The conquests of Jeroboam II. are indicated very briefly
     in 2 Kings xiv. 25-28: cf. Amos vi. 14, where the
     expressions employed by the prophet imply that at the time
     at which he wrote the whole of the ancient kingdom of David,
     Judah included, was in the possession of Israel.

Moab alone offered any serious resistance. It had preserved its
independence ever since the reign of Mesha, having escaped from being
drawn into the wars which had laid waste the rest of Syria. It was now
suddenly forced to pay the penalty of its long prosperity. Jeroboam made
a furious onslaught upon its cities&mdash;Ar of Moab, Kir of Moab, Dibon,
Medeba, Heshbon, Elealeh&mdash;and destroyed them all in succession. The
Moabite forces carried a part of the population with them in their
flight, and all escaped together across the deserts which enclose the
southern basin of the Dead Sea. On the frontier of Edom they begged for
sanctuary, but the King of Judah, to whom the Edomite valleys belonged,
did not dare to shelter the vanquished enemies of his suzerain, and one
of his prophets, forgetting his hatred of Israel in delight at being
able to gratify his grudge against Moab, greeted them in their distress
with a hymn of joy&mdash;"I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon
Elealeh: for upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest the battle
shout is fallen. And gladness is taken away and joy out of the fruitful
fields; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither joyful
noise; no treader shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the
vintage shout to cease. Wherefore my bowels sound like an harp for Moab,
and my inward parts for Kir-Heres. And it shall come to pass, when Moab
presenteth himself, when he wearieth himself upon the high place, and
shall come to his sanctuary to pray, he shall not prevail!"*
</p>
<pre>
     * Isa. xv. 1-9; xvi. 1-12. This prophecy, which had been
     pronounced against Moab "in the old days," and which is
     appropriated by Isaiah (xvi. 13, 14), has been attributed to
     Jonah, son of Amittaî, of Gath-Hepher, who actually lived in
     the time of Jeroboam II. (2 Kings xiv. 25). It is now
     generally recognised as the production of an anonymous
     Judsean prophet, and the earliest authentic fragment of
     prophetic literature which has come down to us.

<p>
This revival, like the former greatness of David and Solomon, was due
not so much to any inherent energy on the part of Israel, as to the
weakness of the nations on its frontiers. Egypt was not in the habit of
intervening in the quarrels of Asia, and Assyria was suffering from
a temporary eclipse. Damascus had suddenly collapsed, and Hadrach or
Mansuati, the cities which sought to take its place, found themselves
fully employed in repelling the intermittent attacks of the Assyrian;
the Hebrews, for a quarter of a century, therefore, had the stage to
themselves, there being no other actors to dispute their possession of
it. During the three hundred years of their existence as a monarchy they
had adopted nearly all the laws and customs of the races over whom they
held sway, and by whom they were completely surrounded. The bulk of the
people devoted themselves to the pasturing and rearing of cattle, and,
during the better part of the year, preferred to live in tents, unless
war rendered such a practice impossible.* They had few industries save
those of the potter** and the smith,*** and their trade was almost
entirely in the hands of foreigners.
</p>
<pre>
     * Cf. the passage in 2 Kings xiii. 5, "And the children of
     Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime." Although the
     word <i>ôhel</i> had by that time acquired the more general
     meaning of <i>habitation</i>, the context here seems to require
     us to translate it by its original meaning tent.

     ** Pottery is mentioned in 2 Sam. xvii. 28; numerous
     fragments dating from the monarchical period have been found
     at Jerusalem and Lachish.

     *** The story of Tubal-Cain (Gen. iv. 22) shows the
     antiquity of the ironworker's art among the Israelites; the
     smith is practically the only artisan to be found amongst
     nomadic tribes.

We find, however, Hebrew merchants in Egypt,* at Tyre, and in
Coele-Syria, and they were so numerous at Damascus that they requested
that a special bazaar might be allotted to them, similar to that
occupied by the merchants of Damascus in Samaria from time immemorial.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The accurate ideas on the subject of Egypt possessed by
     the earliest compilers of the traditions contained in
     Genesis and Exodus, prove that Hebrew merchants must have
     been in constant communication with that country about the
     time with which we are now concerned.

The Hebrew monarchs had done their best to encourage this growing desire
for trade. It was only the complicated state of Syrian politics that
prevented them from following the example of Solomon, and opening
communications by sea with the far-famed countries of Ophir, either in
competition with the Phoenicians or under their guidance. Indeed, as
we have seen, Jehoshaphat, encouraged by his alliance with the house of
Omri, tried to establish a seagoing fleet, but found that peasants could
not be turned into sailors at a day's notice, and the vessel built by
him at Eziongeber was wrecked before it left the harbour.

In appearance, the Hebrew towns closely resembled the ancient Canaanite
cities. Egyptian influences still predominated in their architecture,
as may be seen from what is still left of the walls of Lachish, and they
were fortified in such a way as to be able to defy the military engines
of besiegers. This applies not only to capitals, like Jerusalem, Tirzah,
and Samaria, but even to those towns which commanded a road or mountain
pass, the ford of a river, or the entrance to some fertile plain; there
were scores of these on the frontiers of the two kingdoms, and in
those portions of their territory which lay exposed to the attacks
of Damascus, Moab, Edom, or the Philistines.* The daily life of the
inhabitants was; to all intents, the same as at Arpad, Sidon, or Gaza;
and the dress, dwellings, and customs of the upper and middle
classes cannot have differed in any marked degree from those of the
corresponding grades of society in Syria.

The men wore over their tunic a fringed kaftan, with short sleeves, open
in front, a low-crowned hat, and sandals or shoes of pliant leather; *
they curled their beards and hair, painted their eyes and cheeks, and
wore many jewels; while their wives adopted all the latest refinements
in vogue in the harems of Damascus, Tyre, or Nineveh.** Descendants of
ancient families paid for all this luxury out of the revenues of the
wide domains they had inherited; others kept it up by less honourable
means, by usury, corruption, and by the exercise of a ruthless violence
towards neighbours who were unable to defend themselves.

The king himself set them an evil example, and did not hesitate to
assassinate one of his subjects in order that he might seize a vineyard
which he coveted;* it was not to be wondered at, therefore, that the
nobles of Ephraim "sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a
pair of shoes;"** that they demanded gifts of wheat, and "turned the
needy from their right" when they sat as a jury "at the gate."*** From
top to bottom of the social ladder the stronger and wealthier oppressed
those who were weaker or poorer than themselves, leaving them with no
hope of redress except at the hands of the king.****

Unfortunately, the king, when he did not himself set the example
of oppression, seldom possessed the resources necessary to make his
decisions effective. True, he was chief of the most influential family
in either Judah or Israel, a chief by divine appointment, consecrated
by the priests and prophets of Jahveh, a priest of the Lord,* and he was
master in his own city of Jerusalem or Samaria, but his authority did
not extend far beyond the walls.

     with the unction received by the priests on their admission

It was not the old tribal organisation that embarrassed him, for the
secondary tribes had almost entirely given up their claims to political
independence. The division of the country into provinces, a consequence
of the establishment of financial districts by Solomon, had broken them
up, and they gradually gave way before the two houses of Ephraim and
Judah; but the great landed proprietors, especially those who held royal
fiefs, enjoyed almost unlimited power within their own domains. They
were, indeed, called on to render military service, to furnish forced
labour, and to pay certain trifling dues into the royal treasury;* but,
otherwise, they were absolute masters in their own domains, and the
sovereign was obliged to employ force if he wished to extort any tax or
act of homage which they were unwilling to render. For this purpose
he had a standing army distributed in strong detachments along the
frontier, but the flower of his forces was concentrated round the royal
residence to serve as a body-guard. It included whole companies of
foreign mercenaries, like those Cretan and Carian warriors who, since
the time of David, had kept guard round the Kings of Judah;** these, in
time of war,*** were reinforced by militia, drawn entirely from among
the landed proprietors, and the whole force, when commanded by an
energetic leader, formed a host capable of meeting on equal terms the
armies of Damascus, Edom, or Moab, or even the veterans of Egypt and
Assyria.

     building of which had been begun by Baasha.

     landed estate in Israel, who were in that capacity liable to
     render military service, numbered 60,000 in the time of that
     king; all others were exempt from military service.

The reigning prince was hereditary commander-in-chief, but the
<i>sharzaba</i>, or captain of the troops, often took his place, as in the
time of David, and thereby became the most important person in the
kingdom. More than one of these officers had already turned against
their sovereign the forces which he had entrusted, to them, and these
revolts, when crowned with success, had, on various occasions, in Israel
at any rate, led to a change of dynasty: Omri had been shar zaba when he
mutinied against Zimri, the assassin of Elah, and Jehu occupied the same
position when Elisha deputed him to destroy the house of Omri.
</p>
<p>
The political constitutions of Judah and Israel were, on the whole, very
similar to those of the numerous states which shared the territory of
Syria between them, and their domestic history gives us a fairly exact
idea of the revolutions which agitated Damascus, Hamath, Carchemish,
Arpad, and the principalities of Amanos and Lebanon about the same
period. It would seem, however, that none of these other nations
possessed a literary or religious life of any great intensity. They had
their archives, it is true, in which were accumulated documents relating
to their past history, their rituals of theology and religious worship,
their collections of hymns and national songs; but none of these have
survived, and the very few inscriptions that have come down to us merely
show that they had nearly all of them adopted the alphabet invented
by the Phoenicians. The Israelites, initiated by them into the art of
writing, lost no time in setting down, in their turn, all they could
recall of the destinies of their race from the creation of the world
down to the time in which they lived. From the beginning of the
monarchical epoch onwards, their scribes collected together in the <i>Book
of the Wars of the Lord</i>, the <i>Book of Jashar</i>, and in other works the
titles of which have not survived, lyrics of different dates, in which
nameless poets had sung the victories and glorious deeds of their
national heroes, such as the Song of the Well, the Hymn of Moses, the
triumphal Ode of Deborah, and the blessing of Jacob.* They were able to
draw upon traditions which preserved the memory of what had taken
place in the time of the Judges;** and when that patriarchal form of
government was succeeded by a monarchy, they had narratives of the ark
of the Lord and its wanderings, of Samuel, Saul, David, and Solomon,***
not to mention the official records which, since then, had been
continuously produced and accumulated by the court historians.****
</p>
<pre>
     * The books of <i>Jashar</i> and of the <i>Wars of the Lord</i> appear
     to date from the IXth century B.C.; as the latter is quoted
     in the Elohist narrative, it cannot have been compiled later
     than the beginning of the VIIIth century B.C. The passage in
     Numb. xxi. lib, 15, is the only one expressly attributed by
     the testimony of the ancients to the <i>Book of the Wars of
     the Lord,</i> but modern writers add to this the <i>Song of the
     Well </i>(Numb. xxi. 17b, 18), and the Song of Victory over
     Moab (Numb. xxi. 27&amp;-30). The <i>Song of the Bow</i> (2 Sam. i.
     19-27) admittedly formed part of the <i>Book of Jashar</i>.
     Joshua's Song of Victory over the Amorites (Josh. x. 13),
     and very probably the couplet recited by Solomon at the
     dedication of the Temple (1 Kings viii, 12, 13, placed by
     the LXX. after verse 53), also formed part of it, as also
     the <i>Song of Deborah</i> and the Blessing of Jacob (Gen. xlix.
     1-27).

     ** Wellhausen was the first to admit the existence of a Book
     of Judges prior to the epoch of Deuteronomy, and his opinion
     has been adopted by Kuenen and Driver. This book was
     probably drawn upon by the two historians of the IXth and
     VIIIth centuries B.C. of whom we are about to speak; some of
     the narratives, such as the story of Abimelech, and possibly
     that of Ehud, may have been taken from a document written at
     the end of the Xth or the beginning of the IXth centuries
     B.C.

     *** The revolutions which occurred in the family of David (2
     Sam. ix.-xx.) bear so evident a stamp of authenticity that
     they have been attributed to a contemporary writer, perhaps
     Ahimaaz, son of Zadok (2 Sam. xv. 27), who took part in the
     events in question. But apart from this, the existence is
     generally admitted of two or three books which were drawn up
     shortly after the separation of the tribes, containing a
     kind of epic of the history of the first two kings; the one
     dealing with Saul, for instance, was probably written in the
     time of Jeroboam.

     **** The two lists in which the names of the principal
     personages at the court of David are handed down to us,
     mention a certain Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, who was
     <i>mazhir</i>, or recorder; he retained his post under Solomon (1
     Kings iv. 3).

in the second half of the IXth century B.C., perhaps in the time of
Jehoshaphat, a member of the tribe of Judah undertook to put forth a
fresh edition.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The approximate date of the composition and source of this
     first <i>Jehovist</i> is still an open question., Reuss and
     Kuenen, not to mention others, believe the Jehovist writer
     to have been a native of the northern kingdom; I have
     adopted the opposite view, which is supported by most modern
     critics.
</pre>
<p>
He related how God, after creating the universe out of chaos, had chosen
His own people, and had led them, after trials innumerable, to the
conquest of the Promised Land. He showed, as he went on, the origin of
the tribes identified with the children of Israel, and the covenants
made by Jahveh with Moses in the Arabian desert; while accepting the
stories connected with the ancient sanctuaries of the north and east
at Shechem, Bethel, Peniel, Mahanaim, and Succoth, it was at Hebron
in Judah that he placed the principal residence of Abraham and his
descendants. His style, while simple and direct, is at the same time
singularly graceful and vivacious; the incidents he gives are carefully
selected, apt and characteristic, while his narrative passes from scene
to scene without trace of flagging, unburdened by useless details, and
his dialogue, always natural and easy, rises without effort from the
level of familiar conversation to heights of impassioned eloquence. His
aim was not merely to compile the history of his people: he desired
at the same time to edify them, by showing how sin first came into the
world through disobedience to the commandments of the Most High, and
how man, prosperous so long as he kept to the laws of the covenant, fell
into difficulties as soon as he transgressed or failed to respect
them. His concept of Jahveh is in the highest degree a concrete one: he
regards Him as a Being superior to other beings, but made like unto them
and moved by the same passions. He shows anger and is appeased, displays
sorrow and repents Him of the evil.* When the descendants of Noah build
a tower and a city, He draws nigh to examine what they have done, and
having taken account of their work, confounds their language and thus
prevents them from proceeding farther.** He desires, later on, to confer
a favour on His servant Abraham: He appears to him in human form, and
eats and drinks with him.*** Sodom and Gomorrah had committed abominable
iniquities, the cry against them was great and their sin very grievous:
but before punishing them, He tells Abraham that He will "go down and
see whether they have done according to the cry of it which is come unto
Me; and if not, I will know."****
</p>
<pre>
     * Exod. iv. 14 and xxxii. 10, anger of Jahveh against Moses
     and against Israel; Gen. vi. 6, 7, where He repents and is
     sorry for having created man; and Exod. xxxii. 14, where He
     repents Him of the evil He had intended to do unto Israel.

Elsewhere He wrestles a whole night long with Jacob;* or falls upon
Moses, seeking to kill him, until appeased by Zipporah, who casts the
blood-stained foreskin of her child at her husband's feet.** This book,
though it breathes the spirit of the prophets and was perhaps written
in one of their schools, did not, however, include all the current
narratives, and omitted many traditions that were passing from lip to
lip; moreover, the excessive materialism of its treatment no longer
harmonised with that more idealised concept of the Deity which had
already begun to prevail. Consequently, within less than a century
of its appearance, more than one version containing changes and
interpolations in the narrative came to be circulated,*** till a scribe
of Ephraim, who flourished in the time of Jeroboam II., took up the
subject and dealt with it in a different fashion.****

     *** Schrader and Wellhausen have drawn attention to
     contradictions in the primitive history of humanity as
     presented by the Jehovist which forbid us to accept it as
     the work of a single writer. Nor can these inconsistencies
     be due to the influence of the Elohist, since the latter did
     not deal with this period in his book. Budde has maintained
     that the primitive work contained no account of the Deluge,
     and traced the descent of all the nations, Israel included,
     back to Cain, and he declares he can detect in the earlier
     chapters of Genesis traces of a first Jehovist, whom he
     calls J1. A second Jehovist, J2, who flourished between 800
     and 700 B.C., is supposed to have added to the contribution
     of the first, certain details borrowed from the Babylonian
     tradition, such as the Deluge, the story of Noah, of Nimrod,
     etc. Finally, a third Jehovist is said to have thrown the
     versions of his two predecessors into one, taking J2 as the
     basis of his work.

     **** The date and origin of the Elohist have given rise to
     no less controversy than those of the Jehovist: the view
     most generally adopted is that he was a native of the
     northern kingdom, and flourished about 750 B.C.
</pre>
<p>
Putting on one side the primitive accounts of the origin of the human
race which his predecessors had taken pleasure in elaborating, he
confined his attention solely to events since the birth of Abraham;* his
origin is betrayed by the preference he displays for details calculated
to flatter the self-esteem of the northern tribes. To his eyes, Joseph
is the noblest of all the sons of Jacob, before whom all the rest
must bow their heads, as to a king; next to Joseph comes Reuben, to
whom&mdash;rather than to Judah**&mdash;he gives the place as firstborn. He groups
his characters round Bethel and Shechem, the sanctuaries of Israel;
even Abraham is represented as residing, not at Hebron in Judea, but at
Beersheba, a spot held in deep veneration by pilgrims belonging to the
ten tribes.*** It is in his concept of the Supreme Being, however, that
he differs most widely from his predecessors. God is, according to him,
widely removed from ordinary humanity. He no longer reveals Himself at
all times and in all places, but works rather by night, and appears
to men in their dreams, or, when circumstances require His active
interference, is content to send His angels rather than come in His own
person.****
</p>
<p>
* Budde seems to have proved conclusively that the Elohist did not write
any part of the primitive history of mankind.
</p>
<p>
** Gen. xxxvii. 21, 22, 29, 30; xlii. 22, 27; whereas in Gen. xliii. 3,
8-10, where the narrative is from the pen of the Jehovist, it is Judah
that plays the principal part: it is possible that, in Gen. xxxvii. 21,
Reuben has been substituted in the existing text for Judah.
</p>
<p>
*** Gen. xxi. 31, 33; xxii. 19; the importance of Beersheba as a holy
place resorted to by pilgrims from the northern kingdom is shown in 1
Kings xix. 3, and Amos v. 5; viii. 14.

<p>
Indeed, such cases of active interference are of rare occurrence, and
He prefers to accomplish His purpose through human agents, who act
unconsciously, or even in direct contravention of their own clearly,
expressed intentions.* Moreover it was only by degrees that He revealed
His true nature and title; the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
Joseph, had called Him Elohim, or "the gods," and it was not until
the coming of Moses that He disclosed His real name of Jahveh to His
worshippers.**

     alive."

In a word, this new historian shows us in every line that the
theological instinct has superseded popular enthusiasm, and his work
loses unmistakably in literary interest by the change. We feel that
he is wanting in feeling and inspiration; his characters no longer
palpitate with life; his narrative drags, its interest decreases, and
his language is often deficient in force and colour. But while writers,
trained in the schools of the prophets, thus sought to bring home to
the people the benefits which their God had showered on them, the people
themselves showed signs of disaffection towards Him, or were, at
any rate, inclined to associate with Him other gods borrowed from
neighbouring states, and to overlay the worship they rendered Him
with ceremonies and ideas inconsistent with its original purity. The
permanent division of the nation into two independent kingdoms had had
its effect on their religion as well as on their political life, and
had separated the worshippers into two hostile camps. The inhabitants of
Judah still continued to build altars on their high places, as they had
done in the time before David; there, the devout prostrated themselves
before the sacred stones and before the Asherah, or went in unto
the <i>kedeshôth</i> in honour of Astarte, and in Jahveh's own temple at
Jerusalem they had set up the image of a brazen serpent to which they
paid homage.* The feeling, however, that the patron deity of the chosen
people could have but one recognised habitation&mdash;the temple built for
Him by Solomon&mdash;and that the priests of this temple were alone qualified
to officiate there in an effective manner, came to prevail more and more
strongly in Judaea. The king, indeed, continued to offer sacrifices and
prayer there,** but the common people could no longer intercede with
their God except through the agency of the priests.
</p>
<pre>
     * Cf. what we are told of idolatrous practices in Judah
     under Rehoboam and Abraham (1 Kings xiv. 22-24; xv. 3), and
     of the tolerance of high places by Asa and Jehoshaphat (1
     Kings xv. 14; xxii. 44); even at the period now under
     consideration neither Amaziah (2 Kings xiv. 4) nor Azariah
     (2 Kings xv. 4) showed any disposition to prohibit them. The
     brazen serpent was still in existence in the time of
     Hezekiah, at the close of the VIIIth century B.C. (2 Kings
     xviii. 4).

     ** 2 Kings xvi. 10-16, where Ahaz is described as offering
     sacrifice and giving instructions to the high priest Urijah
     as to the reconstruction and service of the altar; cf. 2
     Chron. xxvi. 16-21, where similar conduct on the part of
     Uzziah is recorded, and where the leprosy by which he was
     attacked is, in accordance with the belief of later times,
     represented as a punishment of the sacrilege committed by
     him in attempting to perform the sacrifice in person.
</pre>
<p>
The latter, in their turn, tended to develop into a close corporation of
families consecrated for generations past to the priestly office; they
came in time to form a tribe by themselves, which took rank among the
other tribes of Israel, and claimed Levi, one of the twelve sons of
Jacob, as its ancestor. Their head, chosen from among the descendants of
Zadok, who had been the first high priest in the reign of Solomon, was
by virtue of his office one of the chief ministers of the crown, and we
know what an important part was played by Jehoiadah in the revolution
which led to the deposition of Athaliah; the high priest was, however,
no less subordinate to the supreme power than his fellow-ministers,
and the sanctity of his office did not avail to protect him from
ill-treatment or death if he incurred the displeasure of his sovereign.*
He had control over a treasury continually enriched by the offerings
of the faithful, and did not always turn his trust to the best uses;
in times of extreme distress the king used to borrow from him as a
last resource, in order to bring about the withdrawal of an invader, or
purchase the help of a powerful ally.** The capital of Israel was of
too recent foundation to allow of its chapel royal becoming the official
centre of national worship; the temple and priesthood of Samaria never
succeeded in effacing the prestige enjoyed by the ancient oracles,
though in the reign of both the first and second Jeroboam, Dan, Bethel,
Gilgal, and Mizpah had each its band of chosen worshippers.***
</p>
<pre>
     * In order to form an idea of the relative positions
     occupied by the king and the high priest, we must read what
     is told of Jehoiadah and Joash (2 Kings xii. 6-16), or
     Urijah and Ahaz (2 Kings xvi. 10-16); the story runs that
     Zechariah was put to death by Joash (2 Chron. xxiv. 22).

     ** Asa did so in order to secure Ben-hadad's help against
     Baasha (1 Kings xv. 18, 19; cf. 2 Chron. xvi. 2, 3): as to
     the revenues by which the treasury of the temple was
     supported and the special dues appropriated to it, cf. 2
     Kings xii. 4, 5, 7-16, and xxii. 4-7, 9.

     *** In the time of Jeroboam II., Bethel, Gilgal, and Dan are
     mentioned by Amos (iv. 4; v. 5, 6; viii. 14), by Hosea (iv.
     15; ix. 15; xii. 12). Mizpah is mentioned by Hosea (v. 1),
     and so is Tabor. The altar of Jahveh on Mount Carmel was
     restored by Elijah (1 Kings xviii. 30).
</pre>
<p>
At these centres adoration was rendered to the animal presentment of
Jahveh,* and even prophets like Elijah and Elisha did not condemn this
as heretical; they had enough to do in hunting down the followers of
Baal without entering into open conflict with the worshippers of the
golden calf. The priesthood of the northern kingdom was not confined to
members of the family of Levi, but was recruited from all the tribes;
it levied a tithe on the harvest, reserved to itself the pick of
the offerings and victims, and jealously forbade a plurality of
sanctuaries,** The <i>Book of the Covenant</i>*** has handed down to us the
regulations in force at one of these temples, perhaps that of Bethel,
one of the wealthiest of them all.
</p>
<pre>
     * The golden calves at Dan and Bethel are referred to by
     Amos (viii. 14) and Hosea (x. 5), where Bethel is called
     Beth-aven; as to the golden calf at Samaria, cf. Amos viii.
     14 and Hos. viii. 5, 6.

     ** Amos iv. 4, 5; v. 21-23.

     *** This is the title given in Exod. xxiv. 7 to a writing
     in which Moses is said to have entered the covenant made
     between Jahveh and Israel; it is preserved, with certain
     interpolations and alterations, in Exod. xx. 23?&mdash;xxiii. 33.
     It was inserted in its entirety in the Elohist narrative,
     there taking the place at present occupied by Deuteronomy in
     the Pentateuch, viz. that of the covenant made between
     Jahveh and Israel prior to the crossing of the Jordan
     (Kuenen, <i>H. C. Onderzoek</i>, i. § 13, No. 32). Reuss tries to
     make out that it was the code promulgated on the occasion of
     Jehoshaphat's legal reforms, which is only referred to in 2
     Chron. xvii. 7-9; cf. xix. 5. A more probable theory is that
     it was the "custom" of one of the great sanctuaries of the
     northern kingdom reduced to writing at the end of the Xth or
     during the IXth century B.C.

The directions in regard to ritual are extremely simple, and the moral
code is based throughout on the inexorable <i>lex talionis</i>, "Life for
life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe."* This brief
code must have been almost universally applicable to every conjuncture
of civil and religious life in Judah no less than in Israel. On one
point only do we find a disagreement, and that is in connection with
the one and only Holy of Holies to the possession of which the southern
kingdom had begun to lay claim: in a passage full of significance
Jahveh declares, "An altar of earth thou shalt make unto Me, and shalt
sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings, thy sheep
and thine oxen: in every place where I record My name I will come unto
thee and I will bless thee. And if thou make Me an altar of stone, thou
shalt not build it of hewn stones: for if thou lift up thy tool upon
it, thou hast polluted it. Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto Mine
altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon."**

<p>
The patriarchs and early ancestors of the race had performed their
sacrifices in the open air, on rude and low altars, differing widely
from lofty and elaborately ornamented erections like those at Jerusalem,
which seem to have borne a resemblance to the altars of the Egyptians:
the author of the <i>Book of the Covenant</i> advises the faithful to follow
the example of those great men rather than that of the Lévites of
Judah. Nevertheless this multiplicity of high places was not without its
dangers; it led the common people to confuse Jahveh with the idols
of Canaan, and encouraged the spread of foreign superstitions. The
misfortunes which had come thick and fast upon the Israelites ever
since the division of the kingdom had made them only too ready to seek
elsewhere that support and consolation which they could no longer find
at home. The gods of Damascus and Assur who had caused the downfall of
Gath, of Calneh, and of Hamath,* those of Tyre and Sidon who lavished
upon the Phoenicians the wealth of the seas, or even the deities of
Ammon, Moab, or Edom, might well appear more desirable than a Being Who,
in spite of His former promises, seemed powerless to protect His own
people. A number of the Israelites transferred their allegiance to
these powerful deities, prostrated themselves before the celestial host,
flocked round the resting-places of Kevan, the star of El, and carried
the tabernacles of the King of heaven;** nor was Judah slow to follow
their example. The prophets, however, did not view their persistent
ill-fortune in the same light as the common people; far from accepting
it as a proof of the power of other divinities, they recognised in it a
mark of Jahveh's superiority.
</p>
<pre>
     * Amos vi. 2; with regard to the destruction of Gath by
     Hazael.

     ** Amos v. 26, 27
</pre>
<p>
In their eyes Jahveh was the one God, compared with Whom the pagan
deities were no gods at all, and could not even be said to exist. He
might, had He so willed it, have bestowed His protection on any one of
the numerous races whom He had planted on the earth: but as a special
favour, which He was under no obligation to confer, He had chosen Israel
to be His own people, and had promised them that they should occupy
Canaan so long as they kept free from sin. But Israel had sinned, Israel
had followed after idols; its misfortunes were, therefore, but the
just penalty of its unfaithfulness. Thus conceived, Jahveh ceased to be
merely the god of a nation&mdash;He became the God of the whole world; and
it is in the guise of a universal Deity that some, at any rate, of the
prophets begin to represent Him from the time of Jeroboam II. onwards.
</p>
<p>
This change of view in regard to the Being of Jahveh coincided with a no
less marked alteration in the character of His prophets. At first they
had taken an active part in public affairs; they had thrown themselves
into the political movements of the time, and had often directed their
course,* by persuasion when persuasion sufficed, by violence when
violence was the only means that was left to them of enforcing the
decrees of the Most High. Not long before this, we find Elisha secretly
conspiring against the successors of Ahab, and taking a decisive part
in the revolution which set the house of Jehu on the throne in place of
that of Omri; but during the half-century which had elapsed since his
death, the revival in the fortunes of Israel and its growing prosperity
under the rule of an energetic king had furnished the prophets with but
few pretexts for interfering in the conduct of state affairs.
</p>
<pre>
     * Cf. the part taken by Nathan in the conspiracy which
     raised Solomon to the throne (1 Kings i. 8, et seq.), and
     previous to this in the story of David's amour with
     Bathsheba (2 Sam. xii. 1-25). Similarly, we find prophets
     such as Ahijah in the reign of Jeroboam I. (1 Kings xi. 29-
     39; cf. xiv. 1-18; xv. 29, 30), and Shemaîah in the reign of
     Rehoboam (1 Kings xii. 22-24), Jehu son of Hananiah under
     Baasha (1 Kings xvi. 1-4, 7, 12, 13), Micaiah son of Imla,
     and Zedekiah under Ahab (1 Kings xxii. 5-28), not to speak
     of those mentioned in the Chronicles, e.g. Azariah son of
     Oded (2 Ghron. xv. 1-8), and Hanani under Asa (2 Ghron. xvi.
     7-10), Jahaziel (2 Ghron. xx. 14-19), and Eliezer, son of
     Dodavahu (2 Ghron. xx. 37), in the time of Johoshaphat. No
     trace of any writings composed by these prophets is found
     until a very late date; but in Chronicles, in addition to a
     letter from Elijah to Jehoram of Juda (2 Ghron. xxi. 12-15),
     we find a reference to the commentary of the prophet Iddo in
     the time of Abijah (2 Ghron. xiii. 22), and to the "History
     of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of
     the kings of Israel" (2 Chron. xx. 34), in the time of
     Jehoshaphat.

<p>
They no longer occupied themselves in resisting the king, but addressed
themselves to the people, pointed out the heinousness of their sins,
and threatened them with the wrath of Jahveh if they persisted in their
unfaithfulness: they came to be spiritual advisers rather than
political partisans, and orators rather than men of action like their
predecessors. Their discourses were carefully prepared beforehand, and
were written down either by themselves or by some of their disciples
for the benefit of posterity, in the hope that future generations
would understand the dangers or witness the catastrophes which their
contemporaries might not live to see. About 760 B.C., Amos of Tekôa,* a
native of Judaea, suddenly made his appearance at Bethel, in the midst
of the festivals which pilgrims had flocked to celebrate in the ancient
temple erected to Jahveh in one of His animal forms.
</p>
<pre>
     * The title of the Book of Amos fixes the date as being "in
     the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of
     Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel" (i. 1), and the
     state of affairs described by him corresponds pretty closely
     with what we know of this period. Most critics fix the date
     somewhere between 760 and 750 B.C., but nearer 760 than 750.
</pre>
<p>
His opening words filled the listening crowd with wonder: "The high
places of Isaac shall be desolate," he proclaimed, "and the sanctuaries
of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of
Jeroboam with the sword."*
</p>
<pre>
     * Amos vii. 9.
</pre>
<p>
Yet Jeroboam had by this time gained all his victories, and never before
had the King of Samaria appeared to be more firmly seated on the throne:
what, then, did this intruder mean by introducing himself as a messenger
of wrath in the name of Jahveh, at the very moment when Jahveh was
furnishing His worshippers with abundant signs of His favour? Amaziah,
the priest of Bethel, interrupted him as he went on to declare that
"Jeroboam should die by the sword, and Israel should surely be led
away captive out of his land." The king, informed of what was going
on, ordered Amos into exile, and Amaziah undertook to communicate this
sentence to him: "O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of
Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: but prophesy not again
any more at Bethel: for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal
house." And Amos replied, "I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's
son; but I was a herdman, and a dresser of sycomore trees: and the
Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said unto me, Go,
prophesy unto My people Israel. Now therefore hear thou the word of the
Lord: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word
against the house of Isaac: therefore thus saith the Lord: Thy wife
shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall
fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou
thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be
led away captive out of his land."*
</p>
<pre>
     * Amos vii. 9-17.
</pre>
<p>
This prophecy, first expanded, and then written down with a purity of
diction and loftiness of thought which prove Amos to have been a master
of literary art,* was widely circulated, and gradually gained authority
as portents indicative of the divine wrath began to accumulate, such as
an earthquake which occurred two years after the incident at Bethel,* an
eclipse of the sun, drought, famine, and pestilence.*** It foretold,
in the first place, the downfall of all the surrounding
countries&mdash;Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and Judah; then,
denouncing Israel itself, condemned it to the same penalties for the
same iniquities. In vain did the latter plead its privileges as the
chosen people of Jahveh, and seek to atone for its guilt by endless
sacrifices. "I hate, I despise your feasts," declared Jahveh, "and I
will take no delight in your solemn assemblies. Yea, though ye offer Me
your burnt offerings and meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither
will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. Take thou away
from Me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy
viols. But let judgment roll down as waters, and righteousness as a
mighty stream."****
</p>
<pre>
     * S. Jerome describes Amos as "rusticus" and "imperitus
     sermone," but modern writers are generally agreed that in
     putting forward this view he was influenced by the statement
     as to the peasant origin of the prophet.

</pre>
<p>
The unfaithfulness of Israel, the corruption of its cities, the pride of
its nobles, had sealed its doom; even at that moment the avenger was at
hand on its north-eastern border, the Assyrian appointed to carry out
sentence upon it.* Then follow visions, each one of which tends
to deepen the effect of the seer's words&mdash;a cloud of locusts,** a
devouring fire,*** a plumb-line in the hands of the Lord,**** a basket
laden with summer fruits&mdash;till at last the whole people of Israel take
refuge in their temple, vainly hoping that there they may escape from
the vengeance of the Eternal. "There shall not one of them flee away,
and there shall not one of them escape. Though they dig into hell,
thence shall Mine hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven,
thence will I bring them down. And though they hide themselves in the
top of Oarmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they
be hid from My sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command
the serpent, and he shall bite them. And though they go into captivity
before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay
them; and I will set Mine eyes upon them for evil and not for good."^

<pre>
     * Most commentators admit that the nation raised up by
     Jahveh to oppress Israel "from the entering in of Hamath
     unto the brook of the Arabah" (Amos vi. 14) was no other
     than Assyria. At the very period in which Amos flourished,
     Assurdân made two campaigns against Hadrach, in 765 and 755,
     which brought his armies right up to the Israelite frontier
     (Schrader, Keilinschrift. Bibliothec, vol. i. pp. 210-
     213).

     ** Amos vii. 1-3.

     *** Amos vii. 4-6.

     **** Amos vii. 7-9. It is here that the speech delivered by
     the prophet at Bethel is supposed to occur (vii. 9); the
     narrative of what afterwards happened follows immediately
     (Amos vii. 10-17).

     ^ Amos viii. 1-3.; Amos ix. 1-4.
</pre>
<p>
For the first time in history a prophet foretold disaster and banishment
for a whole people: love of country was already giving place in the
heart of Amos to his conviction of the universal jurisdiction of God,
and this conviction led him to regard as possible and probable a
state of things in which Israel should have no part. Nevertheless,
its decadence was to be merely temporary; Jahveh, though prepared to
chastise the posterity of Jacob severely, could not bring Himself to
destroy it utterly. The kingdom of David was soon to flourish anew:
"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall overtake
the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the
mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt. And I
will bring again the captivity of My people Israel, and they shall build
the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and
drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit
of them. And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more
be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith the Lord
thy God."*
</p>
<p>
The voice of Amos was not the only one raised in warning. From the midst
of Ephraim, another seer, this time a priest, Hosea, son of Beeri,**
was never weary of reproaching the tribes with their ingratitude, and
persisted in his foretelling of the desolation to come.
</p>
<pre>
     * Amos ix. 13-15.

     ** Hoshea (or Hosea) was regarded by the rabbis as the
     oldest of the lesser prophets, and his writings were placed
     at the head of their collected works. The title of his book
     (Hos. i. 1), where he begins by stating that he preached
     "in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash (Jehoash), King of
     Israel," is a later interpolation; the additional mention of
     Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, is due
     to an attempted analogy with the title of Isaiah. Hosea was
     familiar with the prophecies of Amos, and his own
     predictions show that the events merely foreseen by his
     predecessor were now in course of fulfilment in his day. The
     first three chapters probably date from the end of the reign
     of Jeroboam, about 750 B.C.; the others were compiled under
     his successors, and before 734-733 B.C., since Gilead is
     there mentioned as still forming part of Israel (Hos. vi. 8;
     xii. 12), though it was in that year laid waste and
     conquered by Tiglath-pileser III. Duhm has suggested that
     Hosea must have been a priest from the tone of his writings,
     and this hypothesis is generally accepted by theologians.
</pre>
<p>
The halo of grandeur and renown with which Jeroboam had surrounded
the kingdom could not hide its wretched and paltry character from the
prophet's eyes; "for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of
Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house
of Israel to cease. And it shall come to pass at that day that I
will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."* Like
his predecessor, he, too, inveighed against the perversity and
unfaithfulness of his people. The abandoned wickedness of Gomer, his
wife, had brought him to despair. In the bitterness of his heart, he
demands of Jahveh why He should have seen fit to visit such humiliation
on His servant, and persuades himself that the faithlessness of which
he is a victim is but a feeble type of that which Jahveh had suffered at
the hands of His people. Israel had gone a-whoring after strange gods,
and the day of retribution for its crimes was not far distant: "The
children of Israel shall abide many days without king and without
prince, and without sacrifice and without pillar, and without ephod or
teraphim; afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
Lord their God, and David their king; and shall come with fear unto the
Lord and to His goodness in the latter days."**
</p>
<pre>
     * Hos. i. 4, 5.

     **Hos. i.-iii. Is the story of Hosea and his wife an
     allegory, or does it rest on a basis of actual fact? Most
     critics now seem to incline to the view that the prophet has
     here set down an authentic episode from his own career, and
     uses it to point the moral of his work.
</pre>
<p>
Whether the decadence of the Hebrews was or was not due to the purely
moral and religious causes indicated by the prophets, it was only too
real, and even the least observant among their contemporaries must
have suspected that the two kingdoms were quite unfitted, as to their
numbers, their military organisation, and monetary reserves, to resist
successfully any determined attack that might be made upon them by
surrounding nations. An armed force entering Syria by way of the
Euphrates could hardly fail to overcome any opposition that might be
offered to it, if not at the first onset, at any rate after a very
brief struggle; none of the minor states to be met upon its way, such
as Damascus or Israel, much less those of Hamath or Hadrach, were any
longer capable of barring its progress, as Ben-hadad and Hazael had
arrested that of the Assyrians in the time of Shalmaneser III. The
efforts then made by the Syrian kings to secure their independence had
exhausted their resources and worn out the spirit of their peoples;
civil war had prevented them from making good their losses during the
breathing-space afforded by the decadence of Assyria, and now that
Nature herself had afflicted them with the crowning misfortunes of
famine and pestilence, they were reduced to a mere shadow of what they
had been during the previous century. If, therefore, Sharduris, after
making himself master of the countries of the Taurus and Amanos, had
turned his steps towards the valley of the Orontes, he might have
secured possession of it without much difficulty, and after that there
would have been nothing to prevent his soldiers from pressing on, if
need be, to the walls of Samaria or even of Jerusalem itself. Indeed, he
seems to have at last made up his mind to embark on this venture, when
the revival of Assyrian power put a stop to his ambitious schemes.
Tiglath-pileser, hard pressed on every side by daring and restless foes,
began by attacking those who were at once the most troublesome and most
vulnerable&mdash;the Aramæan tribes on the banks of the Tigris. To give these
incorrigible banditti, who boldly planted their outposts not a score of
leagues from his capital, a free hand on his rear, and brave the fortune
of war in Armenia or Syria, without first teaching them a lesson in
respect, would have been simply to court serious disaster; an Aramæan
raid occurring at a time when he was engaged elsewhere with the bulk
of his army, might have made it necessary to break off a successful
campaign and fall back in haste to the relief of Nineveh or Calah
(Kalakh), just as he was on the eve of gaining some decisive advantage.
Moreover, the suzerainty of Assyria over Karduniash entailed on him the
duty of safeguarding Babylon from that other horde of Aramæans which
harassed it on the east, while the Kaldâ were already threatening its
southern frontier. It is not quite clear whether Nabunazîr who then
occupied the throne implored his help:* at any rate, he took the field
as soon as he felt that his own crown was secure, overthrew the Aramæans
at the first encounter, and drove them back from the banks of the Lower
Zab to those of the Uknu: all the countries which they had seized to the
east of the Tigris at once fell again into the hands of the Assyrians.
</p>
<pre>
     * Nabunazîr is the Nabonassar who afterwards gave his name
     to the era employed by Ptolemy.
</pre>
<p>
This first point gained, Tiglath-pileser crossed the river, and made a
demonstration in force before the Babylonian fortresses. He visited, one
after another, Sippar, Nipur, Babylon, Borsippa, Kuta, Kîshu, Dilbat,
and Uruk, "cities without peer," and offered in all of them sacrifices
to the gods,&mdash;to Bel, to Zirbanît, to Nebo, to Tashmît, and to Nirgal.
Karduniash bowed down before him, but he abstained from giving any
provocation to the Kaldâ, and satisfied with having convinced Nabunazîr
that Assyria had lost none of her former vigour, he made his way back to
his hereditary kingdom.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Most historians believe that Tiglath-pileser entered
     Karduniash as an enemy: that he captured several towns, and
     allowed the others to ransom themselves on payment of
     tribute. The way in which the texts known to us refer to
     this expedition seems to me, however, to prove that he set
     out as an ally and protector of Nabonazir, and that his
     visit to the Babylonian sanctuaries was of a purely pacific
     nature.
</pre>
<p>
The lightly-won success of this expedition produced the looked-for
result. Tiglath-pileser had set out a king <i>de facto</i>; but now that the
gods of the ancient sanctuaries had declared themselves satisfied with
his homage, and had granted him that religious consecration which had
before been lacking, he returned a king de jure as well (745 B.C.). His
next campaign completed what the first had begun. The subjugation of the
plain would have been of little advantage if the highlands had been left
in the power of tribes as yet unconquered, and allowed to pour down
with impunity bands of rapacious freebooters on the newly liberated
provinces: security between the Zab and the Uknu could only be attained
by the pacification of Namri, and it was, therefore, to Namri that the
sea of war was transferred in 744 B.C. All the Cossæan and Babylonian
races intermingled in the valleys on the frontier were put to ransom one
after another.

<p>
These included the Bît-Sangibuti, the Bît-Khambân, the Barrua, the
Bit-Zualzash, the Bît-Matti, the Umliash, the Parsua, the Bît-Zatti,
the Bît-Zabdâdani, the Bît-Ishtar, the city of Zakruti, the Nina, the
Bustus, the Arakuttu, by which the conqueror gradually made his way
into the heart of Media, reaching districts into which none of his
predecessors had ever penetrated. Those least remote he annexed to
his own empire, converting them into a province under the rule of an
Assyrian governor; he then returned to Calah with a convoy of 60,500
prisoners, and countless herds of oxen, sheep, mules, and dromedaries.
Whilst he was thus employed, Assur-dainâni, one of his generals to whom
he had entrusted the pick of his army, pressed on still further to
the north-east, across the almost waterless deserts of Media. The
mountainous district on the shores of the Caspian had for centuries
enjoyed a reputation for wealth and fertility among the races settled
on the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris. It was from thence that they
obtained their lapis-lazuli, and the hills from which it was extracted
were popularly supposed to consist almost entirely of one compact mass
of this precious mineral. Their highest peak, now known as the Demavend,
was then called Bikni,* a name which had come to be applied to the whole
district.
</p>
<pre>
     * The country of Bikni is probably Rhagian Media and Mount
     Bikni, the modern Demavend.
</pre>
<p>
To the Assyrians it stood as the utmost boundary mark of the known
world, beyond which their imagination pictured little more than a
confused mist of almost fabulous regions and peoples. Assur-dainâni
caught a distant glimpse of the snow-capped pyramid of Demavend, but
approached no nearer than its lower slopes, whence he retraced his steps
after having levied tribute from their inhabitants. The fame of this
exploit spread far and wide in a marvellously short space of time, and
chiefs who till then had vacillated in their decision now crowded the
path of the victor, eager to pay him homage on his return: even the King
of Illipi thought it wise to avoid the risk of invasion, and hastened of
his own accord to meet the conqueror. Here, again, Tiglath-pileser
had merely to show himself in order to re-establish the supremacy of
Assyria: the races of the plain, for many years familiar with defeat,
made no pretence of serious resistance, but bowed their necks beneath a
fresh yoke almost without protest.

<p>
Having thus secured his rear from attack for some years at any rate,
Tiglath-pileser no longer hesitated to try conclusions with Urartu. The
struggle in which he now deliberately engaged could not fail to be a
decisive one; for Urartu, buoyed up and borne on the wave of some fifty
years of prosperity, had almost succeeded in reaching first rank
among the Asiatic powers: one more victory over Nineveh, and it would
become&mdash;for how long none might say&mdash;undisputed mistress of the whole of
Asia. Assyria, on the other hand, had reached a. point where its whole
future hung upon a single issue of defeat or victory. The prestige with
which the brilliant campaigns of Assur-nazir-pal and Shalmaneser III.
had invested its name, if somewhat diminished, had still survived its
recent reverses, and the terror inspired by its arms was so great even
among races who had witnessed them from a distance, that the image of
Assyria rose involuntarily before the eyes of the Hebrew prophets as
that of the avenger destined to punish Israel for its excesses.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Cf. Amos vi. 4.
</pre>
<p>
No doubt, during the last few reigns its prosperity had waned and its
authority over distant provinces had gradually become relaxed; but now
the old dynasty, worn out by its own activity, had given place to a
new one, and with this change of rulers the tide of ill-fortune was,
perhaps, at last about to turn. At such a juncture, a successful
campaign meant full compensation for all past disasters and the
attainment of a firmer position than had ever yet been held; whereas
another reverse, following on those from which the empire had already
suffered, would render their effect tenfold more deadly, and, by letting
loose the hatred of those whom fear alone still held in check, complete
its overthrow. It was essential, therefore, before entering on the
struggle, to weigh well every chance of victory, and to take every
precaution by which adverse contingencies might be, as far as possible,
eliminated. The army, encouraged by its success in the two preceding
campaigns, was in excellent fighting order, and ready to march in any
direction without a moment's hesitation, confident in its ability to
defeat the forces of Urartu as it had defeated those of the Medes and
Aramæans; but the precise point of attack needed careful consideration.
Tiglath-pileser must have been sorely tempted to take the shortest
route, challenge the enemy at his most vulnerable point on the shores of
Lake Van, and by a well-aimed thrust deal him a blow from which he
would never, or only by slow degrees, recover. But this vital region
of Urartu, as we have already pointed out, presented the greatest
difficulties of access. The rampart of mountain and forest by which it
was protected on the Assyrian side could only be traversed by means of
a few byways, along which bands of guerrillas could slip down easily
enough to the banks of the Tigris, but which were quite impassable to
any army in full marching order, hampered by its horses, chariots,
and baggage-train: compelled to thread its way, with columns unduly
extended, through the woods and passes of an unknown country, which
daily use had long made familiar to its adversaries, it would have run
the risk of being cut to pieces man by man a dozen times before it could
hope to range its disciplined masses on the field of battle. Former
Assyrian invasions had, as a general rule, taken an oblique course
towards some of the spurs of this formidable chain, and had endeavoured
to neutralise its defences by outflanking them, either by proceeding
westwards along the basins of the Supnat and the Arzania, or eastwards
through the countries bordering on Lake Urumiah; but even this method
presented too many difficulties and too little certainty of success to
warrant Tiglath-pileser in staking the reviving fortunes of his empire
on its adoption. He rightly argued that Sharduris would be most easily
vulnerable in those provinces whose allegiance to him was of recent
date, and he resolved to seek out his foe in the heart of Northern
Syria.

There, if anywhere, every chance was in his favour and against the
Armenian. The scene of operations, while it had long been familiar to
his own generals and soldiers, was, on the other hand, entirely new
ground to those of the enemy; the latter, though unsurpassed in mountain
warfare, lost much of their superiority on the plains, and could not,
with all their courage, make up for their lack of experience. Moreover,
it must not be forgotten that a victory on the banks of the Afrîn or the
Orontes would have more important results than a success gained in the
neighbourhood of the lakes or of Urartu. Not only would it free the
Assyrians from the only one of their enemies whom they had any cause
to fear, but it would also bring back the Hittite kings to their
allegiance, and restore the Assyrian supremacy over the wealthiest
regions of Western Asia: they would thus disable Urartu and reconquer
Syria at one and the same time. Tiglath-pileser, therefore, crossed the
Euphrates in the spring of 743 B.C., neither Matîlu of Agusi, Kushtashpi
of Kummukh, nor their allies daring to interfere with his progress. He
thus advanced as far as Arpad, and, in the first moment of surprise, the
town threw open its gates before him.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Different writers have given different versions of this
     campaign. Some think that Arpad resisted, and that Tiglath-
     pileser was laying siege to it, when the arrival of
     Sharduris compelled him to retire; others prefer to believe
     that Arpad was still in the hands of the Assyrians, and that
     Tiglath-pileser used it as his base of operations. The
     formula ina Arpadda in the Eponym Canon proves that Tiglath-
     pileser was certainly in Arpad: since Arpad belonged to the
     Bit-Agusi, and they were the allies or vassals of Sharduris,
     we must assume, as I have done here, that in the absence of
     the Urartians they did not dare to resist the Assyrians, and
     opened their gates to them.
</pre>
<p>
There, while he was making ready to claim the homage of the surrounding
countries, he learnt that Sharduris was hastening up to the rescue. He
at once struck his camp and marched out to meet his rival, coming up
with him in the centre of Kummukh, not far from the Euphrates, between
Kishtân and Khalpi. Sharduris was at the head of his Syrian contingents,
including the forces of Agusi, Melitene, Kummukh, and Gurgum&mdash;a
formidable army, probably superior in point of numbers to that of the
Assyrians. The struggle lasted a whole day, and in the course of it the
two kings, catching sight of one another on the field of battle, engaged
in personal combat: at last, towards evening, the chariots and cavalry
of Urartu gave way and the rout began. The victors made their way into
the camp at the heels of their flying enemies. Sharduris abandoned his
chariot, and could find nothing but a mare to aid him in his flight;
he threw himself upon her back, careless of the ridicule at that time
attached to the use of such a mount in Eastern countries,* fled at a
gallop all through the night, hard pressed by a large body of cavalry,
crossed the hills of Sibak, and with much difficulty reached the bridge
over the Euphrates.
</p>
<pre>
     * So, too, later on, in the time of Sargon, Rusas, when
     defeated, gets on the back of a mare and rides off.
</pre>
<p>
His pursuers drew rein on the river-bank, and Sharduris re-entered
his kingdom in safety. He had lost nearly 73,000 men, killed or taken
prisoners, in addition to his chariots, and nearly the whole train of
horses, asses, servants, and artisans attached to his army; he left his
tent still standing, and those who were first to enter it laid hands
on his furniture and effects, his royal ornaments, his bed and portable
throne, with its cushions and bearing-poles, none of which had he found
time to take with him. Tiglath-pileser burnt them all on the spot as a
thank-offering, to the gods who had so signally favoured him; the bed
alone he retained, in order that he might dedicate it as a trophy to the
goddess Ishtar of Nineveh.
</p>
<p>
He had covered himself with glory, and might well be proud of his
achievement, yet the victory was in no way a decisive one. The damage
inflicted on the allies, considerable though it was, had cost him dear:
the forces left to him were not sufficient to enable him to finish the
campaign, and extort oaths of allegiance from the Syrian princes before
they had recovered from the first shock of defeat. He returned to
Nineveh, and spent the whole winter in reorganising his troops; while
his enemies, on the other hand, made preparations to repel the attack
energetically. Sharduris could not yet venture outside his mountain
strongholds, but the hope of being reinforced by him, as soon as he
had got together another army, encouraged the Syrian kings to remain
faithful to him in spite of his reverses.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The part played by Sharduris in the events of the years
     which followed, passing mention of which was made by
     Winckler (<i>Gesch. Bab. und Ass</i>,, pp. 224, 225), have been
     fully dealt with by Belck and Lehmann (Chaldische

<p>
Matîlu of Agusi, unable to carry the day against the Assyrians in
the open field, distributed his men among his towns, and resisted all
attacks with extraordinary persistence, confident that Sharduris would
at length come to help him, and with this hope he held out for three
years in his town of Arpad. This protracted resistance need no longer
astonish us, now that we know, from observations made on the spot, the
marvellous skill displayed in the fortification of these Asiatic towns.
The ruins of Arpad have yet to be explored, but those of Samalla have
been excavated, and show us the methods adopted for the defence of a
royal residence about the middle of the century with which we are now
concerned. The practice of building citadels on a square or rectangular
plan, which prevailed so largely under the Egyptian rule, had gradually
gone out of fashion as the knowledge of engineering advanced, and the
use of mines and military engines had been more fully developed among
the nations of Western Asia. It was found that the heavily fortified
angles of the enclosing wall merely presented so many weak points, easy
to attack but difficult to defend, no matter how carefully they might
be protected by an accumulation of obstacles. In the case of fortresses
built on a plain, where the plan was not modified by the nature of the
site, the enclosing wall was generally round or oval in shape, and free
from useless angles which might detract from its strength. The walls
were surmounted by battlements, and flanked at short intervals by round
or square towers, the tops of which rose but little, if indeed at all,
above the level of the curtain. In front of this main wall was a second
lower one, also furnished with towers and battlements, which followed
the outline of the first all the way round at an interval of some yards,
thus acting as a sort of continuous screen to it. The gates were little
less than miniature citadels built into each line of ramparts; the gate
of the outer wall was often surrounded by lower outworks, two square
bastions and walls enclosing an outer quadrangle which had to be crossed
before the real gate was reached.
</p>


<p>
When a breach had been made in this double enclosure, though the town
itself might be taken, the labours of the attacking force were not yet
over. In the very centre of the place, on a sort of artificial mound
or knoll, stood the royal castle, and resistance on the part of its
garrison would make it necessary for the enemy to undertake a second
siege no less deadly and protracted than the first. The keep of Zinjirli
had only a single gate approached by a narrow causeway.

Within, it was divided by walls into five compartments, each of which
was independent of the rest, and had to be attacked separately. Ma-tîlu
knew he could hope for no mercy at the hands of the Assyrians; he
therefore struggled on to the last, and when at length obliged to
surrender, in the year 740 B.C., he paid for his obstinacy by the loss
of his throne, and perhaps also of his life.*

The inaction of Sharduris clearly showed that he was no longer in a
position to protect his allies, and that the backbone of his kingdom
was broken; the kings who had put faith in his help now gave him up, and
ambassadors flocked in from all parts, even from those which were not as
yet directly threatened. Kushtashpi of Kummukh, Tark-hulara of Gturgum,
Pisiris of Carchemish, Uriaîk of Kuî, came to Arpad in person to throw
themselves at the conqueror's feet, bringing with them offerings of
gold and silver, of lead and iron, of ivory, carved and in the tusk,
of purple, and of dyed or embroidered stuffs, and were confirmed in the
possession of their respective territories; Hiram II. of Tyre, moreover,
and Eezin of Damascus sent their greetings to him.*
</p>

     * <i>Annals of Tiglath-pileser III</i>., where the statement at
     the close indicates that Tiglath-pileser received the
     tributary kings of Syria "in Arpad," after he had captured
     that city.
</pre>
<p>
The Patina, who in days gone by had threatened the fortunes of
Assur-nazir-pal, once again endeavoured to pose as the rivals of
Assyria, and Tutammû, sovereign of Unki, the most daring of the minor
states into which the Patina had been split up, declined to take part
in the demonstrations made by his neighbours. Tiglath-pileser marched
on Kinalua, sacked it, built a fortress there, and left a governor and
garrison behind him: Agusi and Unki henceforth sank down to the level of
mere provinces, administered by royal officers in the king's name, and
permanently occupied by Assyrian troops.
</p>
<p>
Northern Syria was thus again incorporated with the empire, but Urartu,
although deprived of the resources with which Syria had supplied it,
continued to give cause for apprehension; in 739 B.C., however, a large
proportion of the districts of Naîri, to which it still clung, was
wrested from it, and a fortress was built at Ulluba, with a view to
providing a stable base of operations at this point on the northern
frontier. A rebellion, instigated, it may be, by his own agents,
recalled Tiglath-pileser to the Amanus in the year 738. The petty kings
who shared with Assyria the possession of the mountains and plains of
the Afrîn could not succeed in living at peace with one another, and
every now and then their disputes broke out into open warfare. Samalla
was at that time subject to a family of which the first members known to
history, Qaral and Panammu, shared Yaudi equally between them. Barzur,
son of Panammu I., had reigned there since about 765 B.C., and there can
be little doubt that he must have passed through the same vicissitudes
as his neighbours; faithful to Urartu as long as Sharduris kept the
upper hand, and to Assyria as soon as Tiglath-pileser had humiliated
Urartu, he had been killed in a skirmish by some rival. His son, Panammu
IL, came to the throne merely as a nominee of his suzerain, and seems to
have always rendered him faithful service; unfortunately, Yaudi was no
longer subject to the house of Panammu, but obeyed the rule of a certain
Azriyahu, who chafed at the presence of an alien power.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Azriyahu of Yaudi was identified with Azariah of Judah by
     G. Smith, and this identification was for a long time
     accepted without question by most Assyriologists. After a
     violent controversy it has finally been shown that the
     <i>Yaudi</i> of Tiglath-pileser III.'a inscriptions ought to be
     identified with the <i>Yadi</i> or <i>Yaudi</i> of the Zinjirli
     inscriptions, and consequently that Azriyahu was not king of
     Judah, but a king of Northern Syria. This view appears to me
     to harmonise so well with what remains of the texts, and
     with our knowledge of the events, that I have had no
     hesitation in adopting it.
</pre>
<p>
Azriyahu took advantage of the events which kept Tiglath-pileser fully
occupied in the east, to form a coalition in favour of himself among the
states on the banks of the Orontes, including some seventeen provinces,
dependencies of Hamath, and certain turbulent cities of Northern
Phoenicia, such as Byblos, Arka, Zimyra, Usnû, Siannu, Coele-Syria,
and even Hadrach itself. It is not quite clear whether Damascus and the
Hebrews took part in this movement. Jeroboam had died in 740, after a
prosperous reign of forty-one years, and on his death Israel seems
to have fallen under a cloud; six months later, his son Zechariah was
assassinated at Ibleam by Shallum, son of Jabesh, and the prophecy
of Amos, in which he declared that the house of Jeroboam should fall
beneath the sword of Jahveh,* was fulfilled. Shallum himself reigned
only one month: two other competitors had presented themselves
immediately after his crime;** the ablest of these, Menahem, son of
Gadi, had come from Tirzah to Samaria, and, after suppressing his
rivals, laid hands on the crown.*** He must have made himself master
of the kingdom little by little, the success of his usurpation being
entirely due to the ruthless energy invariably and everywhere displayed
by him; as, for instance, when Tappuakh (Tiphsah) refused to open
its gates at his summons, he broke into the town and slaughtered its
inhabitants.****
</p>
<pre>
     * Amos vii. 9.

     ** The nameless prophet, whose prediction is handed down to
     us in Zech. ix.&mdash;xi., speaks of three shepherds cut off by
     Javeh in one month (xi. 8); two of these were Zechariah and
     Shallum; the third is not mentioned in the Book of Kings.

     *** 2 Kings xiv. 23-29; xv. 8-15.

     **** 2 Kings xv. 16. The Massoretic text gives the name of
     the town as Tipsah, but the Septuagint has Taphôt, which led
     Thenius to suggest Tappuakh as an emendation of Tipsah:
     Stade prefers the emendation Tirzah.
</pre>
<p>
All the defects of organisation, all the sources of weakness, which for
the last half-century had been obscured by the glories of Jeroboam II.,
now came to the surface, and defied all human efforts to avert their
consequences. "Then," as Hosea complains, "is the iniquity of Ephraim
discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood:
and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.
And they consider not in their hearts that I (Jahveh) remember all their
wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before
My face. They make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes
with their lies. They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by
the baker.... They... devour their judges; all their kings are fallen;
there is none among them that calleth unto Me."* In Judah, Azariah
(Uzziah) had at first shown some signs of ability; he had completed the
conquest of Idumsea, Edom, and had fortified Elath,** but he suddenly
found himself stricken with leprosy, and was obliged to hand over the
reins of government of Jotham.***

<pre>
     * Sos. vii. 1-4, 7.

     ** 2 Kings xiv. 22; in 2 Ghron. xxvi. 6-15 he is credited

     fortress, in addition to campaigns against the Philistines
     and Arabs.

     *** 2 Kings xv. 5; cf. 2 Ghron. xxvi. 19-21. Azariah is also
     abbreviated into Uzziah. Tappuakh was a town situated on the
     borders of Ephraim and Manasseh (Josh. xvi. 8; xvii. 7, 8).
</pre>
<p>
His long life had been passed uneventfully, and without any disturbance,
under the protection of Jeroboam; but the very same defects which had
led to the ruin of Israel were at work also in Judah, and Menahem, in
spite of his enfeebled condition, had nothing to fear in this direction.

<p>
The danger which menaced him came rather from the east and the north,
where Damascus, aroused from its state of lethargy by Rezôn [Rezin] II.,
had again begun to strive after the hegemony of Syria.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The name of this king, written Rezin in the Bible (2 Kings
     xv. 37; xvi. 5, 6, 9), is given as <i>Razunu</i> in the Assyrian
     texts; he was therefore Ilezôn II. A passage in the <i>Annals</i>
     seems to indicate that Rezin's father was prince of a city
     dependent on Damascus, not king of Damascus itself;
     unfortunately the text is too much mutilated to warrant us
     in forming any definite conclusion on this point.
</pre>
<p>
All these princes, when they found that the ambition of Tiglath-pileser
threatened to interfere with their own intrigues, were naturally
tempted to combine against him, and were willing to postpone to a more
convenient season the settlement of their own domestic quarrrels. But
Tiglath-pileser did not give them time for this; he routed Azriyahu, and
laid waste Kullani,* the chief centre of revolt, ravaged the valley of
the Orontes, and carried off the inhabitants of several towns, replacing
them with prisoners taken the year before during his campaign in Naîri.
</p>
<pre>
     * Kullani is the Calno or Calneh mentioned by Isaiah (x. 9)
     and Amos (vi. 2), which lay somewhere between Arpad and
     Hamath; the precise spot is not yet known.
</pre>
<p>
After this feat the whole of Syria surrendered. Rezin and Menahem were
among the first to tender their homage, and the latter paid a thousand
talents of silver for the <i>firman</i> which definitely confirmed his tenure
of the throne; the princes of Tyre, Byblos, Hamath, Carchemish, Milid,
Tabal, and several others followed their example&mdash;even a certain Zabibi,
queen of an Arab tribe, feeling compelled to send her gifts to the
conqueror.
</p>
<p>
A sudden rising among the Aramæan tribes on the borders of Elam obliged
Tiglath-pileser to depart before he had time to take full advantage of
his opportunity. The governors of Lullumi and Naîri promptly suppressed
the outbreak, and, collecting the most prominent of the rebels together,
sent them to the king in order that he might distribute them throughout
the cities of Syria: a colony of 600 prisoners from the town of Amlati
was established in the territory of Damaunu, 5400 from Dur were sent to
the fortresses of Unki, Kunalia, Khuzarra, Taî, Tarmanazi, Kulmadara,
Khatatirra, and Sagillu, while another 10,000 or so were scattered along
the Phoenician seaboard and among the adjacent mountains. The revolt
had meanwhile spread to the nations of Media, where it was, perhaps,
fomented by the agents of Urartu; and for the second time within seven
years (737 B.C.) Tiglath-pileser trampled underfoot the countries over
which he had ridden in triumph at the beginning of his career&mdash;the
Bît-Kapsi, the Bît-Sangibuti, the Bît-Tazzakki, the Bît-Zulazash,
the Bît-Matti, and Umliash. The people of Upash, among the Bît-Kapsi,
entrenched themselves on the slopes of Mount Abirus; but he carried
their entrenchments by storm. Ushuru of Taddiruta and Burdadda of
Nirutakta were seized with alarm, and hid themselves in their mountain
gorges; but he climbed up in pursuit of them, drove them out of their
hiding-places, seized their possessions, and made them prisoners.
Similar treatment was meted out to all those who proved refractory; some
he despoiled, others he led captive, and "bursting upon the remainder
like the downpour of Bammân," permitted none of them to escape. He
raised trophies all along his line of march: in Bau, a dependency of
Bît-Ishtar, he set up a pointed javelin dedicated to Ninip, on which
he had engraved a panegyric of the virtues of his master Assur; near
Shilkhazi, a town founded, in bygone days, by the Babylonians, he
erected a statue of himself, and a pillar consecrated to Marduk in
Til-ashshur. In the following year he again attacked Urartu and occupied
the mountain province of Nâl, which formed one of its outlying defences
(736). The year after he entered on the final struggle with Sharduris,
and led the flower of his forces right under the walls of Dhuspas,* the
enemy's capital.
</p>
<pre>
     * The name is written Turuspas in the inscriptions of
     Tiglath-pileser III.
</pre>
<p>
Dhuspas really consisted of two towns joined together. One of these,
extending over the plain by the banks of the Alaîs and in the direction
of the lake, was surrounded by fertile gardens and villas, in which
the inhabitants spent the summer at their ease. It was protected by
an isolated mass of white and red nummulitic chalk, the steep sides of
which are seamed with fissures and tunnelled with holes and caverns from
top to bottom.

The plateau in which it terminates, and which rises to a height of 300

completely isolated from the other two, and forming, should occasion

stronghold impregnable, and they had succeeded in the attempt.

<p>
There can be little or no doubt, however, that this is merely a variant
of the name usually written as Tuspas, Tuspana, Dhuspana, the Thospia of
classical times; properly speaking, it was the capital of Biainas. The
only access to it was from the western side, by a narrow bridle-path,
which almost overhung the precipice as it gradually mounted to the
summit. This path had been partially levelled, and flanked with walls
and towers which commanded the approach throughout its whole length;
on the platforms at the summit a citadel had been constructed, together
with a palace, temples, and storehouses, in which was accumulated a
sufficient supply of arms and provisions to enable the garrison to tire
out the patience of any ordinary foe; treason or an unusually prolonged
siege could only get the better of such a position. Tiglath-pileser
invested the citadel and ravaged its outskirts without pity, hoping, no
doubt, that he would thus provoke the enemy into capitulating. Day after
day, Sharduris, perched in his lofty eyrie, saw his leafy gardens laid
bare under the hatchet, and his villages and the palaces of his nobles
light up the country round as far as the eye could reach: he did not
flinch, however, and when all had been laid waste, the Assyrians set up
a statue of their king before the principal gate of the fortress, broke
up their camp, and leisurely retired. They put the country to fire and
sword, destroyed its cities, led away every man and beast they could
find into captivity, and then returned to Nineveh laden with plunder.
Urartu was still undaunted, and Sharduris remained king as before; but
he was utterly spent, and his power had sustained a blow from which
it never recovered. He had played against Assur with the empire of the
whole Asiatic world as the stake, and the dice had gone against him:
compelled to renounce his great ambitions from henceforth, he sought
merely to preserve his independence. Since then, Armenia has more than
once challenged fortune, but always with the same result; it fared no
better under Tigranes in the Roman epoch, than under Sharduris in the
time of the Assyrians; it has been within an ace of attaining the goal
of its ambitions, then at the last moment its strength has failed, and
it has been forced to retire worsted from the struggle. Its position
prevented it from exercising very wide influence; hidden away in a
corner of Asia at the meeting-point of three or four great mountain
ranges, near the source of four rivers, all flowing in different
directions, it has lacked that physical homogeneity without which no
people, however gifted, can hope to attain supremacy; nature has doomed
it to remain, like Syria, split up into compartments of unequal size
and strength, which give shelter to half a score of independent
principalities, each one of them perpetually jealous of the rest. From
time to time it is invested with a semblance of unity, but for the
most part it drags on an uneventful existence, dismembered into as many
fragments as there happen to be powerful states around it, its only
chance of complete reunion lying in the possibility of one or other of
these attaining sufficient predominance to seize the share of the others
and absorb it.
</p>
<p>
The subjection of Urartu freed Assyria from the only rival which could
at this moment have disputed its supremacy on the banks of the Euphrates
and the Tigris. The other nations on its northern and eastern frontiers
as yet possessed no stability; they might, in the course of a passing
outburst, cut an army to pieces or annex part of a province, but they
lacked strength to follow up their advantage, and even their most
successful raids were sure, in the long run, to lead to terrible
reprisals, in which their gains were two or three times outweighed by
their losses in men and treasure. For nearly a hundred years Nineveh
found its hands free, and its rulers were able to concentrate all their
energy on two main points of the frontier&mdash;to the south-west on Syria
and Egypt, to the south-east on Chaldæa and Elam. Chaldæa gave little
trouble, but the condition of Syria presented elements of danger. The
loyalty of its princes was more apparent than real; they had bowed their
necks after the fall of Unki, but afterwards, as the years rolled on
without any seeming increase in the power of Assyria, they again took
courage and began once more to quarrel among themselves. Menahem had
died, soon after he had paid his tribute (737 B.c.); his son Pekahiah
had been assassinated less than two years later (736)* and his murderer,
Pekah, son of Remaliah, was none too firmly seated on the throne.
Anarchy was triumphant throughout Israel; so much so that Judah seized
the opportunity for throwing off the yoke it had borne for well-nigh
a hundred years. Pekah, conscious of his inability to suppress the
rebellion, called in Rezin to help him. The latter was already on the
way when Jotham was laid with his fathers (736 B.C.), and it was Ahaz,
the son of Jotham, who had to bear the brant of the assault. He was
barely twenty years old, a volatile, presumptuous, and daring youth,
who was not much dismayed by his position.** Jotham had repaired the
fortifications of Jerusalem, which had been left in a lamentable state
ever since the damage done to them in the reign of Amaziah;*** his
successor now set to work to provide the city with the supply of water
indispensable for its defence,**** and, after repairing the ancient
aqueducts, conceived the idea of constructing a fresh one in the spur of
Mount Sion, which extends southwards.
</p>
<pre>
     * 2 Kings xv. 22-26. The chronology of the events which took
     place between the death of Menahem and the fall of Samaria,
     as presented by the biblical documents in the state in which
     they have been transmitted to us, is radically inaccurate:
     following the example of most recent historians, I have
     adhered exclusively to the data furnished by the Assyrian
     texts, merely indicating in the notes the reasons which have
     led me to adopt certain dates in preference to others.

     ** 2 Kings xv. 38, xvi. 1, 2. Ahaz is called Iaukhazi, i.e.
     Jehoahaz, in the Assyrian texts, and this would seem to have
     been the original form of the name.

     *** The restoration of the walls of Jerusalem by Jotham is
     only mentioned in 2 Chron. xxvii. 3.

     **** We may deduce this from the words of Isaiah (vii. 3),
     where he represents Ahaz "at the end of the conduit of the
     upper pool, in the highway of the fuller's field." Ahaz had
     gone there to inspect the works intended for the defence of
     the aqueduct.
</pre>
<p>
As time pressed, the work was begun simultaneously at each end; the
workmen had made a wide detour underground, probably in order to avoid
the caves in which the kings of Judah had been laid to rest ever since
the time of David,* and they were beginning to despair of ever uniting
the two sections of the tunnel, when they suddenly heard one another
through the wall of rock which divided them. A few blows with the
pick-axe opened a passage between them, and an inscription on the wall
adjoining the entrance on the east side, the earliest Hebrew inscription
we possess, set forth the vicissitudes of the work for the benefit of
future generations. It was scarcely completed when Kezin, who had
joined forces with Pekah at Samaria, came up and laid regular siege to
Jerusalem.**
</p>
<pre>
     * This is the highly ingenious hypothesis put forward and
     defended with much learning by Clermont-Ganneau, in order to
     account for the large curve described by the tunnel.

     ** 2 Kings xvi. 5; cf. 2 Chron. xxviii. 5-8. It was on this
     occasion that Isaiah delivered the prophecies which, after
     subsequent revision, furnished the bulk of chaps, vi. 1&mdash;x. 4.
</pre>
<p>
The allies did not propose to content themselves with exacting tribute
from the young king; they meant to dethrone him, and to set up in
his room a son of Tabeel, whom they had brought with them; they were
nevertheless obliged to retire without effecting a breach in his
defences and leave the final assault till the following campaign. Rezin,
however, had done as much injury as he could to Judah; he had laid waste
both mountain and plain, had taken Elath by storm and restored it to the
Edomites,* and had given a free hand to the Philistines (735).**
</p>
<pre>
     * 2 Kings xvi. 6, where the Massoretic text states that the
     Syrians retained the town, while the Septuagint maintain
     that he restored it to the Edomites.

     ** Chron. xxviii. 18, where a list is given of the towns
     wrested from Judah by the Philistines. The delight felt by
     the Philistines at the sight of Judah's abasement seems to
     be referred to in the short prophecy of Isaiah (xiv. 29-32),
     wrongly ascribed to the year of Ahaz's death.

<p>
The whole position seemed so hopeless, that a section of the people
began to propose surrendering to the mercy of the Syrians.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This seems to be an obvious inference from the words of
     Isaiah (viii. 6): "Forasmuch as this people hath refused the
     waters of Shiloah that go softly, <i>and lose courage because
     of Rezin and Bemaliali's son</i>." [The R.V. reads  "<i>rejoice
     in</i>" Rezin, etc.&mdash;Tr.]
</pre>
<p>
Ahaz looked around him in search of some one on whom he might call for
help. All his immediate neighbours were hostile; but behind them, in the
background, were two great powers who might be inclined to listen to his
appeal&mdash;Egypt and Assyria. Ever since the expedition of Sheshonq into
Asia, Egypt seemed to have lost all interest in foreign politics.
Osorkon had not inherited the warlike propensities of his father,
and his son, Takelôti I., and his grandson, Osorkon II., followed his
example.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The chronology of this period is still very uncertain, and
     the stelae of the Serapseum, which enable us to fix the
     order of the various reigns, yield no information as to
     their length. Sheshonq I. did not reign much longer than
     twenty-one years, which is his latest known date, and we may
     take the reign of twenty-one years attributed to him by
     Manetho as being substantially correct. The latest dates we
     possess are as follows: Osorkon I., twelfth year, and
     Takelôti I., sixth year or seventh year. Lastly, we have a
     twenty-ninth year in the case of Osorkon II., with a
     reference in the case of the twenty-eighth year to the fifth
     year of a Takelôti whose first cartouche is missing, and who
     perhaps died before his father and co-regent. In Manetho,
     Osorkon I. is credited with a reign of fifteen years, and
     his three next successors with a total of twenty-five years
     between them, which is manifestly incorrect, since the
     monuments give twenty-nine years, or twenty-three at the
     very least, if we take into account the double date in the
     case of the first two of these kings. The wisest course
     seems to be to allow forty-five years to Osorkon and his two
     successors: if Sheshonq, as I believe, died in 924, the
     fifty years allotted to the next three Pharaohs would bring

     present, inclined to place the death of Osorkon II.

These monarchs regarded themselves as traditionary suzerains of the
country of Kharu, i.e. of Israel, Judah, Ammon, and Moab, and their
authority may perhaps have been recognised by the Philistines in the
main, but they seldom stirred from their own territory, and contented
themselves with protecting their frontiers against the customary
depredations of the Libyan and Asiatic nomads.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Repressive measures of this kind are evidently referred to
     in passages similar to those in which Osorkon II. boasts of
     having "overthrown beneath his feet the Upper and Lower
     Lotanu," and speaks of the exploits of the sons of Queen
     Kalamâît against certain tribes whose name, though
     mutilated, seems to have been Libyan in character.

Under their rule, Egypt enjoyed fifty years of profound peace, which was
spent in works of public utility, especially in the Delta, where, thanks
to their efforts, Bubastis came to be one of the most splendid among the
cities of secondary importance.*
</p>
<pre>
     * All our knowledge of the history of the temple of Bubastis
     dates from Naville's excavations.
</pre>
<p>
Its temple, which had been rebuilt by Ramses II. and decorated by the
Rames-sides, was in a sorry plight when the XXIInd dynasty came into
power. Sheshonq I. did little or nothing to it, but Osorkon I. entirely
remodelled it, and Osorkon II. added several new halls, including,
amongst others, one in which he celebrated, in the twenty-second year
of his reign, the festival of his deification. A record of some of the
ceremonies observed has come down to us in the mural paintings. There
we see the king, in a chapel, consecrating a statue of himself in
accordance with the ritual in use since the time of Amenôthes III., and
offering the figure devout and earnest worship; all the divinities of
Egypt have assembled to witness the enthronement of this new member of
their confraternity, and take part in the sacrifices accompanying
his consecration. This gathering of the gods is balanced by a human
festival, attended by Nubians and Kushites, as well as by the courtiers
and populace. The proceedings terminated, apparently, with certain
funeral rites, the object being to make the identification of Osorkon
with Osiris complete.

<p>
The Egyptian deities served in a double capacity, as gods of the dead as
well as of the living, and no exception could be made in favour of the
deified Osorkon; while yet living he became an Osiris, and his double
was supposed to animate those prophetic statues in which he appeared as
a mummy no less than those which represented him as still alive.

Another temple of small size, also dedicated to Bastîfc or Pasht, which
had been built in the time of Ramses II., was enlarged by Osorkon I.,
and richly endowed with workshops, lands, cattle, slaves, and precious
metals: Tumu-Khopri of Heliopolis, to mention but one of the
deities worshipped there, received offerings of gold in value by
weight.£120,000, and silver ingots worth £12,000.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This is the small temple afterwards described by Herodotus
     as being dedicated to Hermes.
</pre>
<p>
A country which could afford to indulge in extravagances of this nature
must have been in a flourishing condition, and everything goes to prove
that Egypt prospered under the rule of the early Bubastite kings.
</p>
<p>
The very same causes, however, which had ruined the Ramessides and
the Tanites were now openly compassing the downfall of the Bubastite
dynasty. The military feudalism from which it had sprung, suppressed for
a time by Sheshonq I., developed almost unchecked under his successors.
They had thought to break it up and turn it to their own advantage, by
transferring the more important religious functions and the principal
fiefs to their own sons or nephews. They governed Memphis through
the high priests of Phtah; a prince of the blood represented them at
Khmunu,* another at Khninsu** (Heracleopolis), and others in various
cities of the Delta, each of them being at the head of several thousand
Mashauasha, or Libyan soldiers on whose fidelity they could entirely
rely.
</p>
<pre>
     * E.g. Namrôti, under Piônkhi-Mîamun, whose rights were such
     that he adopted the protocol of the Pharaohs.

     ** Stole 1959 of the Serapæum contains the names of five
     successive princes of this city, the first of whom was
     Namrôti, son of Osorkon II., and high priest of Thebes; a
     member of the same family, named Pefzââbastît, had taken
     cartouches under Osorkon III. of the XXIIIrd dynasty.
</pre>
<p>
Thebes alone had managed to exclude these representatives of the ruling
dynasty, and its princes, guided in this particular by the popular
prejudice, persistently refused to admit into their bodyguard any but
the long-tried Mâzaîu. Moreover, Thebes lost no opportunity of proving
itself to be still the most turbulent of the baronies. Its territory
had suffered no diminution since the time of Hrihor, and half of Upper
Egypt, from Elephantine to Siut, acknowledged its sway.1
</p>
<pre>
     * It is evident that this was so from the first steps taken
     by Piônkhi-Miamun's generals: they meet the army and fleet
     of Tafnakhti and the princes of the north right under the
     walls of Hormopolis, but say nothing of any feudal princes
     of the south. Their silence is explained if we assume that
     Thebes, being a dependency of Ethiopia, retained at that
     date, i.e. in the time of the XXIInd dynasty, the same or
     nearly the same boundaries which it had won for itself under
     the XXIst.

<p>
Through all the changes of dynasty its political constitution had
remained unaltered; Amon still ruled there supreme as ever, and nothing
was done until he had been formally consulted in accordance with ancient
usage. Anputi, in spite of his being a son of Sheshonq, was compelled
to adopt the title of high priest in order to rule in peace, and had
married some daughter or niece of the last of the Painotmu. After his
death, good care was taken to prevent the pontificate from passing to
one of his children, as this would have re-established a Theban dynasty
which might have soon proved hostile to that of Bubastis. To avoid this,
Osorkon I. made over the office and fief to his own son Sheshonq. The
latter, after a time, thought he was sufficiently powerful to follow the
example of Paînotmu and adopt the royal cartouches; but, with all his
ambition, he too failed to secure the succession to the male line of
his descendants, for Osorkon II. appointed his own son Namrôti, already
prince of Khninsu, to succeed him. The amalgamation of these two posts
invested the person on whom they were conferred with almost regal power;
Khninsu was, indeed, as we know, the natural rampart of Memphis and
Lower Egypt against invasion from the south, and its possessor was in a
position to control the fate of the empire almost as he pleased.
Osorkon must have had weighty reasons for taking a step which placed him
practically at the mercy of his son, and, indeed, events proved that but
little reliance could be placed on the loyalty of the Thebans, and that
energetic measures were imperative to keep them in the path of duty or
lead them back to it. The decadence of the ancient capital had sadly
increased since the downfall of the descendants of Hrihor.
</p>


<p>
The few public works which they had undertaken, and which Sheshonq I.
encouraged to the best of his ability, had been suspended owing to want
of money, and the craftsmen who had depended on them for support were
suffering from poverty: the makers of small articles of a religious
or funerary character, carvers of wood or stone, joiners, painters of
mummy-cases, and workers in bronze, alone managed to eke out a bare
livelihood, thanks to commissions still given to them by officials
attached to the temples. Theban art, which in its best period had
excelled in planning its works on a gigantic scale, now gladly devoted
itself to the production of mere knick-knacks, in place of the colossal
figures of earlier days.

<p>
We have statuettes some twelve or fifteen inches high, crudely coloured,
wooden stelæ, shapeless <i>ushâbti</i> redeemed from ugliness by a coating
of superb blue enamel, and, above all, those miniature sphinxes
representing queens or kings, which present with two human arms either
a table of offerings or a salver decorated with cartouches. The starving
populace, its interests and vanity alike mortified by the accession of
a northern dynasty, refused to accept the decay of its fortunes with
resignation, and this spirit of discontent was secretly fomented by the
priests or by members of the numerous families which boasted of their
descent from the Eamessides. Although hereditary claims to the throne
and the pontificate had died out or lost their force in the male line,
they were still persistently urged by the women: consecrated from
their birth to the service of Amon, and originally reserved to sing
his praises or share his nuptial couch, those of them who married
transmitted to their children, and more especially to their daughters,
the divine germ which qualified them for the throne. They and their
followers never ceased to look for the day when the national deity
should shake off his apathy, and, becoming the champion of their cause
against the Bubastite or Tanite usurpers, restore their city to the rank
and splendour from which it had fallen. Namrôti married one of these
Theban princesses, and thus contrived to ward off the danger of revolt
during his lifetime; but on his death or disappearance an insurrection
broke out. Sheshonq II. had succeeded Osorkon II., and he, in his turn,
was followed by Takelôti II. Takelôti chose Kala-mâit, daughter of
Namrôti, as his lawful wife, formally recognised her as queen, and set
up numerous statues and votive monuments in her honour. But all in
vain: this concession failed to conciliate the rebellious, and the whole
Thebaid rose against him to a man. In the twelfth year of his reign he
entrusted the task of putting down the revolt to his son Osorkon, at the
same time conferring upon him the office of high priest. It took several
years to repress the rising; defeated in the eleventh year, the rebels
still held the field in the fifteenth year of the king, and it was not
till some time after, between the fifteenth and twenty-second year of
Takelôti II., that they finally laid down their arms.* At the end of
this struggle the king's power was quite exhausted, while that of the
feudal magnates had proportionately increased. Before long, Egypt was
split up into a number of petty states, some of them containing but a
few towns, while others, following the example of Thebes, boldly annexed
several adjacent nomes. A last remnant of respect for the traditional
monarchy kept them from entirely repudiating the authority of Pharaoh.
They still kept up an outward show of submission to his rule; they paid
him military service when called upon, and appealed to him as umpire in
their disputes, without, however, always accepting his rulings, and when
they actually came to blows among themselves, were content to exercise
their right of private warfare under his direction.** The royal domain
gradually became narrowed down to the Memphite nome and the private
appanages of the reigning house, and soon it no longer yielded the sums
necessary for the due performance of costly religious ceremonies, such
as the enthronement or burial of an Apis. The pomp and luxury usually
displayed on such occasions grew less and less under the successors of
Takelôti II., Sheshonq III., Pimi, and Sheshonq IV.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The story of these events is told in several greatly
     mutilated inscriptions to be found at Karnak on the outer
     surface of the south wall of the Hall of Columns.

     ** It is evident that this was so, from a romance discovered
     by Krall.

     *** One need only go to the Louvre and compare the Apis
     stelae erected during this period with those engraved in the
     time of the XXVIth dynasty, in order to realise the low ebb
     to which the later kings of the XXIInd dynasty had fallen:
     the fact that the chapel and monuments were built under
     their direction shows that they were still masters of
     Memphis. We have no authentic date for Sheshonq II., and the
     twenty-ninth year is the latest known in the case of
     Takelôti II., but we know that Sheshonq III. reigned fifty-
     two years, and, after two years of Pimi, we find a reference
     to the thirty-seventh year of Sheshonq IV. If we allow a
     round century for these last kings we are not likely to be
     far out: this would place the close of the Bubastite dynasty
     somewhere about 780 B.C.
</pre>
<p>
When the last of these passed away after an inglorious reign of at least
thirty-seven years, the prestige of his race had so completely declined
that the country would have no more of it; the sceptre passed into the
hands of another dynasty, this time of Tanite origin.* It was probably
a younger branch of the Bubastite family allied to the Ramessides
and Theban Pallacides. Petu-bastis, the first of the line, secured
recognition in Thebes,** and throughout the rest of Egypt as well, but
his influence was little greater than that of his predecessors; as in
the past, the real power was in the hands of the high priests.

One of them, Auîti by name, even went so far, in the fourteenth or
fifteenth year, as to declare himself king, and had his cartouches
inscribed on official documents side by side with those of the Tanite
monarch.* His kingship died with him, just as that of Patnotmu had done
in similar circumstances, and two years later we find his successor,
Harsiisît, a mere high priest without pretensions to royalty.
</p>
<pre>
     * No. 26 of Legrain's inscriptions tells us the height of
     the Nile in the sixteenth year of Petubastît, which was also
     the second year of King Auîti. Seeing that Auîti's name
     occurs in the place occupied by that of the high priest of
     Thebes in other inscriptions of the same king, I consider it
     probable that he was reigning in Thebes itself, and that he
     was a high priest who had become king in the same way as
     Paînotmu under the XXIst dynasty.
</pre>


<p>
Doubtless his was not an isolated case; all the grandees who happened
to be nearly related either to the dethroned or to the reigning houses
acted in like manner, and for the first time for many years Egypt
acknowledged the simultaneous sway of more than one legitimate Pharaoh.
Matters became still worse under Osorkon III.; although he, too,
introduced a daughter of Anion into his harem, this alliance failed to
give him any hold over Thebes, and even the Seven Nomes and the Delta
were split up to such an extent that at one time they included something
like a score of independent principalities, three of which, Hermopolis,
Heracleopolis, and Tentramu, were administered by kings who boasted
cartouches similar to those of Tanis and Bubastis.
</p>
<p>
About 740 B.C. there appeared in the midst of these turbulent and
extortionate nobles a man who, by sheer force of energy and talent,
easily outstripped all competitors. Tafnakhti was a chief of obscure
origin, whose hereditary rights extended merely over the village of
Nutirît and the outskirts of Sebennytos. One or two victories gained
over his nearest neighbours encouraged him to widen the sphere of his
operations. He first of all laid hands on those nomes of the Delta
which extended to the west of the principal arm of the Nile, the Saite,
Athribite, Libyan, and Memphite nomes; these he administered through
officers under his own immediate control; then, leaving untouched the
eastern provinces, over which Osorkon III. exercised a make-shift,
easygoing rule, he made his way up the river. Maitumu and the Fayum
accepted him as their suzerain, but Khninsu and its king, Pefzââbastît,
faithful to their allegiance,* offered strenuous resistance.
</p>
<pre>
     * Pefzââbastît, King of Heracleopolis, seems to be identical
     with the Pharaoh Pefzâbastît of the Berlin sarcophagus.
</pre>
<p>
He then crossed over to the right bank, and received the homage of
Heliopolis and Phebtepahê; he put the inhabitants of Uabu to ransom,
established a close blockade of Khninsu, and persuaded Namrôti, King of
Khmunu, to take an oath of allegiance. At length, those petty kings and
princes of the Said and the Delta who still remained unconquered called
upon Ethiopia, the only power capable of holding its ground against him,
for help. The "vile Kaushu" (Cush) probably rose to be an independent
state about the time when Sheshonq and the Bubastite kings came into
power.

Peopled by Theban settlers, and governed by the civil and religious code
of Thebes, the provinces which lay between the cataract of Hannek and
the confluence of the two Mies soon became a second Thebaid, more barren
and less wealthy than the first, but no less tied to the traditions
of the past. Napata, its capital, lay in the plain at the foot of a
sandstone cliff, which rose perpendicularly to a height of nearly two
hundred feet, its summit, when viewed from the southwest, presenting an
accidental resemblance to a human profile.* This was the <i>Du-uabu</i>, or
Sacred Mount, in the heart of which the god was supposed to have his
dwelling; the ruins of several temples can still be seen near the
western extremity of the hill, the finest of them being dedicated to a
local Amon-Râ.

This Amon was a replica of the Theban Amon on a smaller scale, and was
associated with the same companions as his prototype, Maut, his consort,
and Khonsu, his son. He owed his origin to the same religious concepts,
and was the central figure of a similar myth, the only difference being
that he was represented in composite shape, with a ram's head; perhaps
a survival from some earlier indigenous deity, such as Didun, for
instance, who had been previously worshipped in those parts; his priests
lived in accordance with the rules of the Theban hierarchy.
</p>




<p>
We can readily believe that when Hrihor extorted the title of "Royal Son
of Kaushu" from the weaklings who occupied the throne at the close of
the Ramesside dynasty, he took care to install one of the members of
his family as high priest at Napata, and from henceforward had the whole
country at his bidding. Subsequently, when Paînotmu II. was succeeded by
Auputi at Thebes, it seems that the Ethiopian priests refused to ratify
his election. Whether they conferred the supreme power on one of their
own number, or whether some son of Paînotmu, flying from the Bubastite
kings, arrived at the right moment to provide them with a master, is not
quite clear.

The kings of Ethiopia, priests from the first, never lost their
sacerdotal character. They continued to be men of God, and as such it
was necessary that they should be chosen by the god himself. On the
death of a sovereign, Amon at once became regent in the person of his
prophet, and continued to act until the funeral rites were celebrated.
As soon as these ceremonies were completed, the army and the people
collected at the foot of the Sacred Mount; the delegates of the various
orders of the state were led into the sanctuary, and then, in their
presence, all the males of the royal family&mdash;"the king's brothers," as
they were called&mdash;were paraded before the statue of the god; he on whom
the god laid his hand as he passed was considered to be the chosen one
of Amon, and consecrated king without delay.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This is the ritual described in the <i>Stele of the
     Enthronement</i>. Perhaps it was already in use at Thebes under
     the XXIst and XXIInd dynasties, at the election of the high
     priest, whether he happened to be a king or not; at any
     rate, a story of the Ptolemaic period told by Synesius in
     <i>The Egyptian</i> seems to point to this conclusion.
</pre>
<p>
As may be readily imagined, the new monarch thus appointed by divine
dictation was completely under the control of the priests, and before
long, if he failed to prove sufficiently tractable, they claimed the
right to dispense with him altogether; they sent him an order to commit
suicide, and he obeyed. The boundaries of this theocratic state varied
at different epochs; originally it was confined to the region between
the First Cataract and the mouth of the Blue Nile. The bulk of the
population consisted of settlers of Egyptian extraction and Egyptianised
natives; but isolated, as they were, from Egypt proper by the rupture of
the political ties which had bound them to the metropolis, they ceased
to receive fresh reinforcements from the northern part of the valley as
they had formerly done, and daily became more closely identified with
the races of various origin which roamed through the deserts of Libya or
Arabia. This constant infiltration of free or slavish Bedâwin blood and
the large number of black women found in the harems of the rich, and
even in the huts of the common people, quickly impaired the purity of
the race, even among the tipper classes of the nation, and the type came
to resemble that of the negro tribes of Equatorial Africa.*
</p>

     * Taharqa furnishes us with a striking example of this
     degeneration of the Egyptian type. His face shows the
     characteristic features of the black race, both on the

     Sinjirli.

The language fared no better in the face of this invasion, and the
written character soon became as corrupt as the language; words foreign
to the Egyptian vocabulary, incorrect expressions, and barbarous errors
in syntax were multiplied without stint. The taste for art decayed,
and technical ability began to deteriorate, the moral and intellectual
standard declined, and the mass of the people showed signs of relapsing
into barbarism: the leaders of the aristocracy and the scribes alone
preserved almost intact their inheritance from an older civilisation.
Egypt still attracted them: they looked upon it as their rightful
possession, torn from them by alien usurpers in defiance of all sense
of right, and they never ceased to hope that some day, when the god saw
fit, they would win back their heritage. Were not their kings of the
posterity of Sibu, the true representatives of the Ramessides and the
solar race, compared with whom the northern Pharaohs, even those whose
mothers ranked as "worshippers" of Amon, were but mere mushroom kings?
Thebes admitted the validity of their claims: it looked to them for
help, and the revolts by which it had been torn ever since the reign of
Osorkon II. were, perhaps, instigated by the partisans of Ethiopia. In
the time of Petubastis its high priests, Harsiisît and Takelôti, were
still connected with the Tanites; after that it placed itself under
the immediate orders of Ethiopia, and the pontificate disappeared. The
accession of a sovereign who was himself invested by hereditary right
with the functions and title of high priest of Amon henceforth rendered
the existence of such an office superfluous at Thebes: it would almost
have meant an <i>imperium in imperio</i>. The administration of religious,
and perhaps also of political, affairs was, therefore, handed over
to the deputy prophet, and this change still further enhanced the
importance of the "female worshippers of the god." In the absence of
the king, who had his capital at Napata, they remained the sole
representatives of legitimate authority in the Thebaid: the chief among
them soon came to be regarded as a veritable <i>Lady of Thebes</i>, and,
subject to the god, mistress of the city and its territory.
</p>
<p>
It is not quite clear whether it was Piônkhi Miamun or one of his
immediate predecessors who took possession of the city. The nomes
dependent on Amon followed the example of the capital, and the whole
Theban territory as far as Siut had been occupied by Ethiopian troops,
when in the twenty-first year of the king's reign the princes of the
Delta and Middle Egypt appealed to the court of Napata for help.

Even had they not begged it to do so, it would have been compelled
before long to intervene, for Tafnakhti was already on his way to
attack it; Piônkki charged Luâmarsakni and Pu-arama, the generals he had
already stationed in the Thebaid, to hold Tafnakhti in check, till he
was able to get together the remainder of his army and descend the Nile
to support them. Their instructions were to spare none of the rebellious
towns, but to "capture their men and their beasts, and their ships on
the river; to allow none of the fellaheen to go out into the fields,
nor any labourer to his labour, but to attack Hermopolis and harass it
daily." They followed out these orders, though, it would seem, without
result, until the reinforcements from Nubia came up: their movements
then became more actively offensive, and falling on Tafnakhti's ships,
which were making for Thebes heavily laden with men and stores, they
sunk several of them.

<p>
Anxious to profit by this first success, they made straight for
Heracleopolis with a view to relieving it. Tafnakhti, accompanied by the
two kings Namrôti and Auputi, was directing the siege in person; he
had under his command, in addition to contingents from Busiris, Mendès,
Thoth, and Pharbaîthos, all the vassals of Osorkon III., the successor
of Petubastis and titular Pharaoh of the whole country. The Ethiopian
fleet engaged the Egyptian ships at the end of the island of
Heracleopolis, near the mouth of the canal leading from the Nile to the
Bahr-Yusuf.* Tafnakhti was defeated, and the remnants of his squadron
took refuge in Pipuga under cover of his land forces.** At dawn, the
next day, the Ethiopians disembarked and gave battle. The struggle was
long and fierce, but indecisive. Luâmarsakni and Puarama claimed the
victory, but were obliged to effect a retreat on the day following
their so-called success, and when they dropped anchor in the harbour of
Hermopolis, they found that Namrôti had made his way back to the city by
land and forestalled them. Powerless to hold the field without support,
he collected all the men and cattle he could lay hands on, and awaited
the progress of events behind his ramparts. The Ethiopians invested the
town, and wrote to inform Piônkhi of what they had done&mdash;not, however,
without some misgiving as to the reception which awaited their
despatches. And sure enough, "His Majesty became enraged thereat, even
as a panther: 'If they have allowed a remnant of the warriors of the
north to remain, if they have let one of them escape to tell of the
fight, if they make him not to die in their slaughter, then by my life,
by the love of Râ, by the praise of Amon for me, I will myself go down
and overthrow that which Tafnakhti hath done,*** I will compel him to
give up war for ever! Therefore, after celebrating the festivals of the
New Year, when I shall have sacrificed to Amon of [Napata], my father,
in his excellent festival wherein he appears in his procession of the
New Year, when he shall have sent me in peace to look upon the [Theban]
Amon in his festivals at Thebes, and when I shall have carried his image
in procession to Luxor, in the festival celebrated in his honour among
the festivals of Thebes, on the night of the feast appointed in the
Thebaid, established by Râ at the creation, when I have led him in the
procession and brought him unto his throne, on the day for introducing
the god, even the second of Athyr, then will I make the enemy taste the
savour of my claws.'"
</p>
<pre>
     * The ancient geographers looked upon the nome of
     Heraoleopolis as a large island, its southern boundary
     being, probably, the canal of Harabshent: the end of the
     island, which the Egyptians called "the forepart of
     Khninsu," was probably Harabshent and its environs.

     third person&mdash;"that which he hath done... then will I make
     him taste," etc.
</pre>
<p>
The generals did their very utmost to appease their master's wrath
before he appeared on the scene. They told off a force to keep watch
over Hermopolis while they themselves marched against the nome of Uabu;
they took Oxyrrhynchos by storm, with "the fury of a water-spout," and
informed the king of this achievement; but "his heart was not softened
thereby." They crossed over to the right bank; they crushed the people
of the north under the walls of Tatehni,* they forced the walls of the
town with the battering-ram, and killed many of the inhabitants, amongst
others a son of Tafnakhti, whose body they sent to the king; but "his
heart was not softened thereby."
</p>
<p>
They then pushed on as far as Haït Bonua** and sacked it, but still
failed to regain favour. On the 9th of Thoth, Piônkhi came down to
Thebes, and after hasty attendance at the services to Amon, went to
rejoin the vanguard of his army under the walls of Hermopolis.

"No sooner had his Majesty quitted the cabin of his ship, than the
horses were harnessed and the charioteers in their places; the fear of
his Majesty spread even to the Nomads of Asia, and all hearts trembled
before him." Piônkhi drove back the enemy behind their walls, pitched
his tent to the south-west of the city, threw up earth-works, and
built terraces so as to place his bowmen and sling-ers on a level
with the battlements of its towers. At the end of three days, Namrôti,
finding himself hard pressed on every side, resolved to surrender. He
sent envoys to Piônkhi laden with rich presents, and despatched Queen
Nsitentmahît after them, to beg for mercy from the women who had
accompanied the Ethiopian, his wives, concubines, daughters, or royal
sisters. Their entreaties were graciously received, and Namrôti ventured
to come in person, leading a horse with his right hand and shaking in
his left a sistrum of gold and lapis-lazuli; he knelt down and presented
with his salutations the long train of gifts which had gone before him.
Piônkhi visited the temple of Thoth, and there, amidst the acclamations
of soldiers and priests, offered up the customary sacrifices.

He then made his way to the palace and inspected its courts, chambers,
treasury, and storehouses, and reviewed the whole household, including
even Namrôti's own wives and daughters, though "he turned not his face
towards any one of them." He next went on to the stud-farms, and was
indignant to find that the horses had suffered from hunger during the
siege. Thoroughbreds were probably somewhat scarce at Napata, and he
had, no doubt, reckoned on obtaining new blood and a complete relay
of chargers from the Egyptian stables; his chances of doing so seemed
likely to vanish if brood mares and stallions had everywhere been
debilitated by the hardships of war. He reserved a part of the booty for
himself, handed over the balance to the priests of Amon at Karnak, and
also, before he left, received tribute from Heracleopolis. Pefzââbastît
brought him horses, the pick of his stables, slaves laden with gold
and silver and precious stones; then burying his face in the dust,
he offered worship to his liberator: "Hell had swallowed me up, I was
plunged into darkness, and lo, now a light has been given me. Since I
have found no man to love me in the day of adversity, or to stand by me
in the day of battle, save only thee, O victorious king, who hast torn
away the night from above me, I will be thy servant, I and all my house,
and Khninsu shall pay tribute into thy treasury. For, as to thee, thou
art Harmakhis, chief of the imperishable stars, thou art king, even as
he is king, and even as he doth not destroy himself, neither shalt thou
destroy thyself!"
</p>
<p>
The downfall of Khmunu led all who might still have shown resistance
in Middle Egypt to lay down their arms also. The fortress of
Pisakhmakhpirrî* dominated the gorges of Lahunît, and thus commanded the
entrance to the Fayum; but the son of Tafnakhti agreed to surrender it,
provided he were allowed to march out with the honours of war.
</p>
<pre>
     * This fortress, which bears a name compounded with that of
     Osorkon I., must have been rebuilt by that monarch on the
     site of an earlier fort; the new name remained in use under
     the XXIInd and XXIIIth dynasties, after which the old one
     reappears. It is Illahun, where Petrie discovered the
     remains of a flourishing town of the Bubastite epoch.
</pre>
<p>
Shortly after, Maîtumu threw open its gates, and its example was
followed by Titauî; at Maîtumu there was rioting among the Egyptians in
the streets, one party wishing to hold out, the other to surrender, but
in the end the latter had their way.* Piônkhi discharged his priestly
duties wherever he went, and received the local taxes, always being
careful to reserve a tenth for the treasury of Amon-Râ; the fact that
his army was kept under rigid control, and that he showed great clemency
to the vanquished, helped largely to conciliate those who were not
bound by close ties of interest to the cause of Tafnakhti. On reaching
Memphis, Piônkhi at once had recourse to the persuasive methods which
had hitherto served him so well, and entered into negotiations with the
garrison. "Shut not yourselves up in forts, and fight not against the
Upper Country,** for Shu the god of creation, when I enter, he entereth,
and when I go out, he goeth out, and none may repel my attacks. I will
present offerings to Phtah and to the divinities of the White Wall,
I will honour Sokari in his mysterious coffer, I will contemplate
Eîsânbuf,*** then I will return from thence in peace. If ye will trust
in me, Memphis shall be prosperous and healthy, even the children shall
not cry therein. Behold the nomes of the South; not a soul has been
massacred there, saving only the impious who blasphemed God, and these
rebels have been executed." 
</p>
<pre>
     * Maritumu, or Maîtumu, is the modern Meîdum, associated in
     the inscription with the characteristic epithet, Pisokari-
     Nibu-Suazu, or "temple of Sokari, master of the
     transfiguration." Titauî lay exactly on the frontier between
     Upper and Lower Egypt&mdash;hence its name, which signifies
     "commanding the two regions;" it was in the Memphite nome,
     and Brugsch identifies it with the Greek city of Acanthos,
     near Dahshur, but this position appears to me to be too
     close to Memphis and too far from the boundary of the nome;
     I should prefer to place Titauî at Kafr el-Ayat or
     thereabouts.

     ** I.e. against Piônkhi, who was master of the Upper
     Country, that is, of Thebes and Ethiopia, and the forces
     from the whole of the valley to the south of Memphis who
     accompanied him.

     *** Lit., "He who is on the South of his Wall," a name given
     to one of the quarters of Memphis, and afterwards applied to
     the god Phtah, who was worshipped in that quarter.
</pre>
<p>
This eloquence, however, was of no avail. A detachment of archers,
sailors, and engineers sent to make a reconnaissance of the harbour was
taken by surprise and routed with loss, and on the following night
Tafnakhti suddenly made his appearance on the spot. He had the 8000 men
who were defending it paraded before him, and made them a speech, in
which he pointed out the great natural strength of the position, the
stoutness of the walls and the abundance of provisions; he then mounted
his horse, and making his way a second time through the enemy's
outposts, headed straight for the Delta in order to levy reinforcements
there. The next day, Piônkhi went in person to examine the approaches of
the city in which his ancestors had once been throned. There was a full
Nile, and the river came right up to the walls. He sailed close in along
the whole of the eastern front, and landed on the north, much vexed and
discomfited at finding it so strongly fortified. Even the common
soldiers were astonished, and began to discuss among themselves the
difficulties of the undertaking with a certain feeling of
discouragement. It would be necessary, they declared, to open a regular
siege, "to make an inclined plane leading to the city, throw up-
earthworks against its walls, bind ladders, set up masts and erect spars
all around it." Piônkhi burst into a rage when these remarks were
repeated to him: a siege in set form would have been a most serious
enterprise, and would have allowed the allied princes time to get
together fresh troops. He drove his ships full speed against the line of
boats anchored in the harbour, and broke through it at the first onset;
his sailors then scaled the bank and occupied the houses which
overlooked it. Reinforcements concentrated on this point gradually
penetrated into the heart of the city, and after two days' fighting the
garrison threw down their arms. The victor at once occupied the temples
to save them from pillage: he then purified Memphis with water and
natron, ascended in triumph to the temple of Phtah, and celebrated there
those rites which the king alone was entitled to perform. The other
fortresses in the neighbourhood surrendered without further hesitation.
King Auputi of Tentramu,* prince Akaneshu,** and prince Petisis tendered
the homage of their subjects in person, and the other sovereigns of the
Delta merely waited for a demonstration in force on the part of the
Ethiopians before following their example.

<pre>
     * Probably the original of the statue discovered by Naville
     at Tel-el-Yahudîyeh. Tentramu and Taânu, the cities of
     Auputi, are perhaps identical with the biblical Elim (Exod.
     xvi. 1) and the Daneon Portus of Pliny on the Red Sea, but
     Naville prefers to identify Daneon with the Tonu of the
     <i>Berlin Papyrus No. 1</i>. I believe that we ought to look for
     the kingdom of Auputi in the neighbourhood of Menzaleh, near
     Tanis.

     ** Akaneshu ruled over Sebennytos and in the XVIIth nome.
     Naville discovered at Samannud the statue of one of his
     descendants, a king of the same name, perhaps his grandson,
     who was prince of Sebennytos in the time of Psammetichus I.
</pre>
<p>
Piônkhi crossed the Nile and marched in state to Heliopolis, there to
receive the royal investiture.
</p>
<p>
He offered up prayers at the various holy places along the route, such
as the sanctuary of Tumu at Khriâhu and the temple of the Ennead who
dwelt in the cavern from which the Northern Nile was supposed to spring;
he then crossed over Mount Ahu, bathed his face in the reputed source
of the river, and at length penetrated into the dwelling-place of Râ.
He ascended the steps leading to the great chapel in order that he might
there "see Râ in Hâît-Banbonu even himself. All unattended, he drew the
bolt, threw open the doors, contemplated his father Râ in Hâît-Banbonu,
adjusted Ra's boat Mâdît and the Saktit of Shu, then closed the doors
again, affixed a seal of clay, and impressed it with the royal signet."
He had thus submitted his conduct for the approval of the god in whom
all attributes of royalty were vested, and the god had legitimatised his
claims to universal rule: he was henceforth the master, not merely <i>de
jure</i> but <i>de facto</i> as well, and the kings who had hitherto declined to
recognise him were now obliged to bow reverently before his authority.
</p>
<p>
Osorkon was the first to submit, and did so before the close of
Piônkhi's stay at Heliopolis; when the latter pitched his camp near
Kahani* in the Athribite nome, the nobles of the Eastern Delta, both
small and great, came one after another with their followers; among
them Patinifi of Pisapti, Paimau of Busiris, Pabîsa of Khriâhu and of
Pihâpi,** besides a dozen others.
</p>
<pre>
     * Kahani is, perhaps, the modern Kaha, some distance to the
     north of Qaliub.

     ** Pisapti stood on the present site of Shaft-el-ïïineh.
     Khriâhu, as we know, formed part of the Heliopolitan nome,
     and is, very possibly, to be identified with Babylon of
     Egypt, the Postât of the Arabs; Pihâpi was a place not far
     from the supposed source of the Southern Nile.
</pre>
<p>
He extended his favour to all alike, merely stipulating that they should
give him the best of their horses, and undertake to keep careful watch
over the prosperity of their stud farms. But Tafnakhti still held out,
and seemed determined to defy him to the end; he had set fire to his
palace and taken refuge in the islands on the river, and had provided
a hiding-place for himself at Masudît among the marshes on the coast
in case of final defeat. A victory gained over him by the Ethiopian
generals suddenly induced him to sue for peace. He offered to disband
his men and pay tribute, provided he was guaranteed undisturbed
possession of Sais and of the western districts of the Delta; he
refused, however, to sue for pardon in person, and asked that an envoy
should be sent to receive his oath of allegiance in the temple of Nit.
Though deserted by his brother princes and allies, he still retained
sufficient power to be a thorn in his conqueror's side; his ultimate
overthrow was certain, but it would have entailed many a bloody
struggle, while a defeat might easily have shaken the fidelity of the
other feudatory kings, and endangered the stability of the new dynasty.
Piônkhi, therefore, accepted the terms offered him without modification,
and asked for no guarantee beyond the oath taken in the presence of
the gods. News was brought him about this time that Cynopolis and
Aphroditopolis had at last thrown open their gates, and accordingly he
summoned his vassals for the last time to his camp near Athribis. With
the exception of Tafnakhti, they all obeyed the call, including two
minor kings of Upper and two of Lower Egypt, together with barons of
lesser rank; but of these, Namrôti alone was admitted to the royal
apartments, because he alone was circumcised and ate no fish; after
this the camp was broken up, and the Ethiopians set out on their return
journey southwards. Piônkhi may well have been proud of the result of
this campaign, both for himself and for his country. The empire of the
Pharaohs, which had for the last hundred and fifty years been divided,
was now re-established from the confluence of the Niles to the shores
of the Mediterranean, but it was no longer Egypt that benefited by the
change. It was now, after many years of slavery, the turn of Ethiopia
to rule, and the seat of power was transferred from Thebes or Memphis to
Napata. As a matter of fact, the fundamental constitution of the kingdom
underwent no great modification; it had merely one king the more to rule
over it&mdash;not a stranger, as we are often tempted to conclude, when we
come to measure these old-world revolutions by our modern standards
of patriotism, but a native of the south, who took the place of those
natives of the north who had succeeded one another on the throne since
the days of Smendes. In fact, this newly crowned son of Râ lived a very
long way off; he had no troops of his own further north than Siut,
and he had imposed his suzerainty on the rival claimants and reigning
princes without thereby introducing any change in the constitution
of the state. In tendering their submission to him, the heads of the
different nomes had not the slightest intention of parting with their
liberty; they still retained it, even though nominally dependent, and
continued, as in the past, to abuse it without scruple. Namrôti was king
at Khmunu, Pefzââbastît at Khninsu, Auputi at Tentramu, and Osorkon
III. at Bubastis; the prestige investing the Tanite race persisted so
effectively that the annalists give to the last-named precedence over
the usurpers of the Ethiopian dynasty; the Tanites continued to be the
incarnate representatives of legitimate power, and when Osorkon III.
died, in 732, it was his son Psamutis who was regarded as the Lord of
Egypt. Tafnakhti had, in his defeat, gained formal recognition of his
royalty. He was no longer a mere successful adventurer, a hero of the
hour, whose victories were his only title-deeds, whose rights rested
solely on the argument of main force. Piônkhi, in granting him amnesty,
had conferred official investiture on him and on his descendants.
Henceforth his rule at Sais was every whit as legitimate as that of
Osorkon at Bubastis, and he was not slow in furnishing material proof of
this, for he granted himself cartouches, the uraeus, and all the other
insignia of royalty. These changes must have been quickly noised abroad
throughout Asia. Commercial intercourse between Syria and Egypt was
maintained as actively as ever, and the merchant caravans and fleets
exported with regularity the news of events as well as the natural
products of the soil or of industry. The tidings of an Ethiopian
conquest and of the re-establishment of an undivided empire in the
valley of the Nile, coming as they did at the very moment when the first
effects of the Assyrian revival began to be so keenly felt, could not
fail to attract the attention and arouse the hopes of Syrian statesmen.
The Philistines, who had never entirely released themselves from the
ties which bound them to the Pharaohs of the Delta, felt no repugnance
at asking for a renewal of their former protection.

As for the Phoenicians, the Hebrews, Edom, Moab, Ammon, and Damascus,
they began to consider whether they had not here, in Africa, among the
members of a race favourably disposed towards them by the memories of
the past and by its ambition, hereditary allies against Nineveh. The
fact that Egypt was torn by domestic dissensions and divided into a
score of rival principalities in no way diminished their traditional
admiration for its wealth or their confidence in its power; Assyria
itself was merely an agglomeration of turbulent provinces, vassal
cities, and minor kingdoms, artificially grouped round the ancient
domain of Assur, and yet the convulsions by which it was periodically
shaken had not prevented it from developing into the most formidable
engine of war that had ever threatened the peace of Asia. The African
hosts, whether led by ordinary generals or by a king of secondary
rank, formed none the less a compact army well fitted by numbers and
organisation to hold its own against any forces which Tiglath-pileser
might put into the field; and even should the supreme Pharaoh be
unwilling to throw the full weight of his authority into the balance,
yet an alliance with one of the lesser kings, such as the lord of Sais
or of Bubastis, would be of inestimable assistance to any one fortunate
enough to secure it. It is true that, in so far as the ultimate issue
was concerned, there was little to be gained by thus pitting the two
great powers together and persuading one to fight against the other;
the victor must, in the long run, remain master alike of those who had
appealed for help and of those who had fought against him, and if Egypt
emerged triumphant, there would be nothing for it but to accept her
supremacy. In either event, there could be no question of independence;
it was a choice between the hegemony of Egypt or that of Assyria.
</p>
<p>
From the moment that Tiglath-pileser had made his appearance on the
northern horizon, the nations of Southern Syria had instinctively looked
to Pharaoh for aid. There seems to have been an Egyptian faction in
Samaria, even during the disorders which broke out after the death of
Jeroboam II., and perhaps it was a hope of overcoming it easily which
led Menahem of his own accord to invoke the still remote suzerainty
of Nineveh, after the fall of Unki in 738;* later on, when Pekah had
assassinated Pekahiah and entered into alliance with Eezin, he adopted
the view of those who saw no hope of safety save from the banks of the
Nile, his only reason for doing so being, apparently, because the
kings of the fallen dynasty had received support from the valley of
the Tigris. Hosea continually reproached his countrymen with this
vacillating policy, and pointed out the folly of it: "Ephraim is like
a silly dove without understanding; they call unto Egypt, they go unto
Assyria; when they shall go I will spread My net upon them," said the
Eternal.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The existence of an Egyptian faction at this period has
     been admitted by Kittel. Winckler has traced to the Arabian
     or Idumæan Muzri everything previously referred to Egypt.
     His arguments seem to me to be, in many cases, convincing,
     as I shall point out where necessary, but I think he carries
     his theory too far when he systematically excludes Egypt and
     puts Muzri in its place. Egypt, even in its decadent state,
     was a far more important power than the Arabian Muzri, and
     it seems unreasonable to credit it with such a limited share
     in the politics of the time. I cannot believe that any other
     power is intended in most of those passages in the Hebrew
     writings and Assyrian inscriptions in which the words
     Mizraîm and Muzri occur.

     ** Hos. vii. 11, 12.
</pre>
<p>
They were to be given up to Assyria and dispersed, and while some were
to go into Assur and eat unclean food, Ephraim was to return into Egypt;
"for, lo, they are gone away from destruction, yet Egypt shall gather
them up, Memphis shall bury them."* Nevertheless, they persisted in
negotiating with Egypt, and though there was as yet no formal alliance
between Samaria and Sais or Tanis, their relations were so close that no
enemy of Israel could look for protection from Psamuti or his vassals.
Ahaz had, therefore, nothing to hope from this quarter, and was
compelled by the force of circumstances to throw himself into the arms
of Assyria, if he decided to call in outside aid at all. His prophets,
like those of Pekah, strenuously forbade him to do so, and among them
was one who was beginning to exert a marvellous influence over all
classes of society&mdash;Isaiah, the son of Amoz. He had begun his career
in the year that Uzziah died,** and had continued to prophesy without
interruption during the brief reign of Jotham.***

When Jahveh first appeared to him, in the smoke of the altar, seated
on a throne and surrounded by seraphim, a sense of his own unworthiness
filled him with fear, but an angel purified his lips with a live coal,
and he heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who
will go for us?" and he replied, "Here am I; send me," whereupon Jahveh
gave him this message: "Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye
indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make
their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes and
hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again
and be healed." Then the prophet asked, "Lord, how long?" And Jahveh
answered, "Until cities be waste without inhabitant and houses without
man, and the land become utterly waste, and Jahveh have removed men far
away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land. And if
there be yet a tenth in it, it shall be eaten up; as a terebinth, and as
an oak, whose stock remaineth when they are felled, so the holy seed is
the stock thereof."*

<p>
Judah, though less powerful, was quite as corrupt as his brethren of
Israel, and the divine wrath threatened him no less than them; it rested
with himself, however, to appease it by repentance, and to enter again
into divine favour after suffering his punishment; the Eternal would
then gather together on Mount Sion those of His faithful people who had
survived the crisis, and would assure them a long period of prosperity
under His law. The prophet, convinced that men could in no wise alter
the decrees of the Highest, save by repentance alone, was astonished
that the heads of the state should strive to impede the progress of
events that were happening under their very eyes, by the elaborately
useless combinations of their worldly diplomacy. To his mind, the
invasion of Pekah and Eezin was a direct manifestation of the divine
anger, and it filled him with indignation that the king should hope to
escape from it by begging for an alliance against them with one of
the great powers: when Jahveh should decide that the punishment was
sufficient for the crime, He would know how to shatter His instruments
without any earthly help. Indeed, Isaiah had already told his master,
some days before the allied kings appeared, while the latter was busy
superintending the works intended to supply Jerusalem with water, to
"Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint,
because of these two tails of smoking firebrands.... Because Syria hath
counselled evil against thee, Ephraim also, and the son of Bemaliah,
saying, Let us go up against Judah, hem it in, carry it by storm, and
set up the son of Tabeel as king: thus saith the Lord God, It shall not
stand, neither shall it come to pass." If, however, the course of the
divine justice was to be disturbed by the intervention of a purely human
agency, the city would doubtless be thereby saved, but the matter would
not be allowed to rest there, and the people would suffer even more
at the hands of their allies than they had formerly endured from their
enemies. "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call
his name Immanuel&mdash;God with us.... For before the child shall know
to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou
abhorrest shall be forsaken," and yet "Jahveh shall bring upon thee, and
upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come,
from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah."* And then, employing one
of those daring apologues, common enough in his time, the prophet took
a large tablet and wrote upon it in large letters two symbolical
names&mdash;<i>Spoil-speedeth, Prey-hasteth</i>&mdash;and set it up in a prominent
place, and with the knowledge of credible witnesses went in unto the
prophetess his wife. When the child was born in due course, Jahveh bade
him call it <i>Spoil-speedeth, Prey-hasteth</i>, "for before he shall have
knowledge to cry, My father and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and
the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the King of Assyria."
But the Eternal added, "Forasmuch as this people hath refused the waters
of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the
river [the Euphrates], strong and many:* and he shall come up over all
his channels, and go over all his banks: and he shall sweep onward into
Judah; he shall overflow and pass through; he shall reach even to the
neck, and the stretching of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy
land, O Immanuel [God-with-us]!"*** Finding that Egypt was in favour
of his adversaries, Ahaz, in spite of the prophet's warnings, turned to
Assyria.****

At one time he had found himself so hard pressed that he invoked the
aid of the Syrian gods, and made his eldest son pass through the fire in
order to propitiate them:* he collected together all the silver and gold
he could find in his own treasury or in that of the temple and sent it
to Tiglath-pileser, with this message: "I am thy servant and thy son:
come up and save me out of the hand of the King of Syria, and out of the

Tiglath-pileser came in haste, and Rezin and Pekah, at the mere tidings
of his approach, desisted from their attack on Jerusalem, separated, and
retired each to his own kingdom. The Assyrian king did not immediately
follow them up. He took the road leading along the coast, after leaving
the plains of the middle Orontes, and levied tribute from the Phoenician
cities as he passed; he then began by attacking the western frontier
of Israel, and sent a body of troops against the Philistines, who were
ceaselessly harassing Judah. Hannon, King of Gaza, did not await the
attack, but fled to Egypt for safety, and Ahaz breathed freely, perhaps
for the first time since his accession. This, however, was only a
beginning; the real struggle took place in the following year, and was
hotly contested. In spite of the sorry pass to which its former defeats
and present discords had brought it, Damascus still possessed immense
wealth, and its army, when reinforced by the Arabian and Israelite
contingents, was capable of holding its own for a long time against
the battalions of Assyria, even if it could not hope to conquer them.
Unfortunately for its chances, Eezin had failed to inherit the military
capacity of his great predecessors, Ben-hadad and Hazael; he allowed
Tiglath-pileser to crush the Hebrews without rendering them any
effective assistance. Pekah fought his best, but he lost, one after
another, the strongholds which guarded his northern frontier&mdash;Ijon,
Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, and Hazor; he saw the whole of
Naphtali and Gilead laid waste, and their inhabitants carried off into
Assyria without his being able to prevent it; he himself being obliged
to evacuate Samaria and take refuge in the mountains almost unattended.
Judah followed, with mingled exultation and disquietude, the
vicissitudes of the tragic drama which was thus enacted before its
eyes, and Isaiah foretold the speedy ruin of the two peoples who had but
yesterday threatened to enslave it. He could already see the following
picture in his mind's eye: "Damascus is taken away from being a city,
and it shall be a ruinous heap. The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they
shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them
afraid."*
</p>
<pre>
     * Both of these Aroêrs lay beyond Jordan&mdash;one in Reuben,
     afterwards Moab (Judg. xi. 26; Jer. xlviii. 19); the other
     in Amnion, afterwards Gad (Josh. xiii. 25; 2 Sam. xxiv. 5);
     here they stand for the countries beyond Jordan which
     Tiglath-pileser had just laid waste. The tradition preserved
     in 1 Citron, v. 26 stated that these inhabitants of Gad and
     Reuben were led into captivity by Pul, i.e. Tiglath-pileser.
</pre>
<p>
"The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from
Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the
children of Israel, saith the Lord of hosts! And it shall come to pass
in that day, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness
of his flesh shall wax lean. And it shall be as when the harvestman
gathereth the standing corn, and his arm reapeth the ears; yea, it shall
be as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Ephraim. Yet there shall
be left therein gleanings, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three
berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost
branches of a fruitful tree, saith Jahveh, the God of Israel!... In that
day shall his strong cities be as the forsaken places in the wood, and
on the mountain top, which were forsaken from before the children of
Israel:* and it shall be as a desolation. For thou hast forgotten the
God of thy salvation."**
</p>
<pre>
     * This is probably an allusion to the warlike exploits
     performed during Rezin and Pekah's invasion of Judaea, a
     year or two previously.

     ** Isa. xvii. 1-6, 9, 10.
</pre>
<p>
Samaria was doomed to helplessness for many a day to come, if not for
ever, but it had taken a whole year to lay it low (733); Tiglath-pileser
returned in 732, and devoted yet another year to the war against
Damascus. Eezin had not been dismayed by the evil fortune of his
friends, and had made good his losses by means of fresh alliances. He
had persuaded first Mutton II. of Tyre, then Mitinti of Askalon, and
with the latter a section of the Philistines, to throw in their lot with
him; he had even won over Shamshieh, queen of the Arabs, and with her
a number of the most warlike of the desert tribes; for himself, he had
taken up a position on the further side of Anti-Lebanon, and kept strict
watch from Mount Hermon on the roads leading from the valley of the
Jordan to the plains of the Abana, in order to prevent the enemy from
outflanking him and taking him in the rear. But all to no purpose;
Tiglath-pileser bore directly down upon him, overwhelmed him in a
pitched battle, obliged him to take refuge behind the walls of Damascus,
and there besieged him.

The city was well fortified, amply supplied with provisions, and
strongly garrisoned; the siege was, therefore, a long one, and the
Assyrians filled up the time by laying waste the fertile country at
the foot of Anti-Lebanon. At last Rezin yielded, gave himself up
unconditionally, and was forthwith executed: eight thousand of his
followers were carried off to Kîr, on the confines of Elam,* his kingdom
was abolished, and a Ninevite governor was installed in his palace, by
whom the former domain of Damascus and the territory lately wrested from
Israel were henceforth to be administered.
</p>
<pre>
     * 2 Kings xvi. 9. Kîr is generally located in Armenia,
     Media, or Babylonia; a passage in Isaiah (xxii. 6), however,
     seems to point to its having been somewhere in the direction
     of Elam, and associated with the Aramæans on the banks of
     the Tigris. The Assyrian monuments have not, as yet, yielded
     confirmation of the details given by the <i>Book of the Kings</i>
     in regard to the captivity of the inhabitants of Damascus. A
     fragmentary tablet, giving an account of the death of Rezin,
     was discovered by H. Raw-linson, but it was left in Assyria,
     and no one knows what has since become of it.
</pre>


<p>
The coalition he had formed did not long survive its leader.* Mutton
hastily came to an understanding with the conqueror; Mitinti, like
Hannon, fled into Egypt, and his place was taken by Kukibtu, a partisan
of Assyria. Hoshea, son of Elah, rebelled against Pekah, assassinated
him, and purchased the right to reign over what was left of Israel for
ten talents of gold.** Shamshieh alone held out.

     time of David, as far as is known up to the present time:&mdash;

<pre>
     ** 2 Kings xv. 30. The inscription published by H.
     Rawlinson, merely states that "they overthrew Pekah, their
     king, and I promoted Auzi [to the kingship] over them. I
     received [from him] X talents of gold and... talents of
     silver...."
</pre>


<p>
She imagined herself to be safe among the sands of the desert, and it
never occurred to her that the heavy masses of the Assyrian army would
dream of venturing into these solitudes. Detachments of light cavalry
were sent in pursuit of her, and at first met with some difficulties;
they were, however, eventually successful; the Armenian and Cappadocian
steeds of the Ninevite horsemen easily rode down the queen's meharis.
</p>




<p>
Their success made a great impression on the Arab tribes, and induced
the Mashaî, Timaî Sabasans, Khaiapæans, Badanæans, and Khattiæans to
bend the knee before Assyria. They all sent envoys bearing presents of
gold and silver, camels, both male and female, and spices:* even the
Muzri, whose territory lay to the south of the Dead Sea, followed their
example, and a certain Idibiel was appointed as their chief.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Delitzsch has identified the names of several of these
     races with names mentioned in the Bible, such as the Temah,
     Massah, Ephah, Sheba.

     ** The name Muzri, as Winckler has shown, here refers, not
     to Egypt, but to a canton near Edom, the Nabatsea of the
     Greco-Roman geographers.
</pre>
<p>
While his lieutenants were settling outstanding issues in this fashion,
Tiglath-pileser held open courts at Damascus, where he received the
visits and homage of the Syrians. They came to assure themselves by the
evidence of their own eyes of the downfall of the power which had for
more than one hundred years checked the progress of Assyria. Those who,
like Uassarmi of Tabal, showed any sign of disaffection were removed,
the remainder were confirmed in their dignities, subject to payment of
the usual tribute, and Mutton of Tyre was obliged to give one hundred
talents of gold to ransom his city. Ahaz came to salute his preserver,
and to obtain a nearer view of the soldiers to whom he owed continued
possession of Jerusalem;* the kings of Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Askalon,
the Philistines and the nomads of the Arabian desert, carried away by
the general example, followed the lead of Judah, until there was not a
single prince or lord of a city from the Euphrates to the river of Egypt
who had not acknowledged himself the humble vassal of Nineveh.

<pre>
     * 2 Kings xvi. 10-12. The <i>Nimroud Inscrip</i>. merely mentions
     his tribute among that of the Syrian kings.
</pre>
<p>
With the downfall of rezin, Syria's last hope of recovery had vanished;
the few states which still enjoyed some show of independence were
obliged, if they wished to retain it, to make a parade of unalterable
devotion to their Ninevite master, or&mdash;if they found his suzerainty
intolerable&mdash;had to risk everything by appealing to Egypt for help.
</p>
<p>
Much as they may have wished from the very first to do so, it was too
early to make the attempt so soon after the conference at Damascus;
Tiglath-pileser had, therefore, no cause to fear a rebellion among them,
at any rate for some years to come, and it was just as well that
this was so, for at the moment of his triumph on the shores of the
Mediterranean his interests in Chaldæa were threatened by a serious
danger. Nabonazîr, King of Karduniash, had never swerved from the
fidelity which he had sworn to his mighty ally after the events of 745,
but the tranquillity of his reign had been more than once disturbed by
revolt. Borsippa itself had risen on one occasion, and endeavoured to
establish itself as an independent city side by side with Babylon.
</p>
<p>
When Nabonazîr died, in 734, he was succeeded by his son Nabunâdinzîri,
but at the end of a couple of years the latter was assassinated during
a popular outbreak, and Nabushumukîn, one of his sons, who had been
implicated in the rising, usurped the crown (732). He wore it for
two months and twelve days, and then abdicated in favour of a certain
Ukînzîr.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The following is as complete a list as can at present be
     compiled of this Babylonian dynasty, the eighth of those
     registered in Pinches' Canons (cf. Rost, <i>Untersucli. zur
     altorient. Gesch.</i>, p. 27):&mdash;

It included twenty-two kings, and lasted for about three hundred and
fifty years.
</p>
<p>
The latter was chief of the Bît-Amukkâni, one of the most important
among the Chaldæan communities;* the descendants of the Aramaean nomads
were thus once more placed upon the throne, and their accession put an
end to the relations which had existed for several centuries between
Assyria and Karduniash.
</p>
<pre>
     * The chronicle is silent with regard to the origin of
     Ukînzîr, but Tiglath-pileser, who declines to give him the
     title of "King of Babylon," says that he was <i>mar Amuhlcâni</i>
     = son of Amukkâni. Pinches' <i>Canon</i> indicates that Ukînzîr
     belonged to a dynasty the name of which may be read either
     Shashi or Shapi. The reading Shapi at once recalls the name
     of Shapîa, one of the chief cities of the Bît Amukkâni; it
     would thus confirm the evidence of the Nimroud Inscription.

These marauders, who had always shown themselves impatient of any
settled authority, and had never proffered more than a doubtful
submission to even the most triumphant invader, were not likely to
accept the subordinate position which members of the presiding dynasty
had been, for the most part, content to occupy. It was more probable
that they would, from the very first, endeavour to throw off the
suzerainty of Nineveh. Tiglath-pileser gave the new dynasty no time to
settle itself firmly on the throne: the year after his return from Syria
he got together an army and marched against it. He first cleared the
right bank of the Tigris, where the Pukudu (Pekod) offered but a feeble
resistance; he annexed their territory to the ancient province of
Arrapkha, then crossed the river and attacked the Kaldi scattered among
the plains and marshes of the Shatt el-Haî.

The Bît-Shilâni were the first to succumb; their king Nabushabshi was
impaled before one of the gates of his capital, Sarrabânu, the town
itself was taken by storm, plundered and dismantled, and 55,000 of its
inhabitants were led captive into Assyria. After the Bît-Shilâni, came
the turn of the Bît-Shaali. Dur-Illataî, their capital, was razed to
the ground, and its population, numbering 50,400 men and women, was
deported. Their chief, Lakiru, who had shown great bravery in the
struggle, escaped impalement, but was sent into captivity with his
people, a Ninevite governor being appointed in his place. Ukînzîr, who
was, as we know, hereditary prince of the Bit-Amuk-kâni, came up in
haste to defend his appanage, and threw himself into his fortress at
Shapîa: Tiglath-pileser cut down the gardens and groves of palms which
lent it beauty, burnt the surrounding farms and villages, and tried,
without success, to make a breach in the walls; he still, however,
maintained the siege, but when winter came on and the place still held
out, he broke up his camp and retreated in good order, leaving the
districts which he had laid waste occupied by an Assyrian force. Before
his departure, he received homage and tribute from most of the Aramæan
chiefs, including those of Balasu and the Bît-Dakkuri, of Nadînu, and
even of the Bît-Yakîn and Merodach-baladan, whose ancestors had never
before "kissed the foot" of an Assyrian conqueror. In this campaign he
had acquired nearly three-fourths of the whole Babylonian kingdom; but
Babylon itself still refused to yield, and it was no easy task to
compel it to do so. Tiglath-pileser spent the whole of the year 730 in
preparing for another attack, and in 729 he again appeared in front of
Shapîa, this time with greater success: Ukînzîr fell into his hands,
Babylon opened its gates, and he caused himself to be proclaimed King of
Sumir and Akkad within its walls.* Many centuries had passed since the
two empires had been united under the rule of a single master, or an
Assyrian king had "taken the hands of Bel." Tiglath-pileser accepted
the condition attached to this solemn investiture, which obliged him
to divide his time between Calah and Babylon, and to repeat at every
festival of the New Year the mystic ceremony by which the god of the
city confirmed him in his office.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Contemporary documents do not furnish us with any
     information as to these events. The <i>Eponym Canon</i> tells us
     that "<i>the king took the hands of Bel</i>." Pinches'
     <i>Chronicle</i> adds that "in the third year of Ukînzîr,
     Tiglath-pileser marched against Akkad, laid waste the Bît-
     Amukkâni, and took Ukînzîr prisoner; Ukînzîr had reigned
     three years in Babylon. Tiglath-pileser followed him upon
     the throne of Babylon."

     ** The <i>Eponym Canon</i> proves that in 728 B.C., the year of
     his death, he once more took the hands of Bel.
</pre>
<p>
His Babylonian subjects seem to have taken a liking to him, and perhaps
in order to hide from themselves their dependent condition, they
shortened his purely Assyrian name of Tukulti-abal-esharra into the
familiar sobriquet of Puru or Pulu, under which appellation the native
chroniclers later on inscribed him in the official list of kings: he did
not long survive his triumph, but died in the month of Tebeth, 728 B.C.,
after having reigned eighteen years over Assyria, and less than two
years over Babylon and Chaldæa.
</p>
<p>
The formulae employed by the scribes in recording historical events
vary so little from one reign to another, that it is, in most cases, a
difficult matter to make out, under the mask of uniformity by which they
are all concealed, the true character and disposition of each successive
sovereign. One thing, however, is certain&mdash;the monarch who now came
upon the scene after half a century of reverses, and in a brief space
restored to his armies the skill necessary to defeat such formidable
foes as the Armenians or the Syrians of Damascus, must have been an able
general and a born leader of men. Yet Nineveh had never suffered
long from a lack of capable generals, and there would be little to
distinguish Tiglath-pileser from any of his predecessors, if we could
place nothing more than a few successful campaigns to his credit.
His claim to a pre-eminent place among them rests on the fact that he
combined the talents of the soldier with the higher qualities of the
administrator, and organised his kingdom in a manner at once so simple
and so effective, that most of the Oriental powers down to the time of
the Grecian conquest were content to accept it as a model. As soon as
the ambition of the Assyrian kings began to extend beyond the region
confined between the Khabur and the Greater Zab, they found it necessary
to parcel out their territory into provinces under the authority of
prefects for the purpose of preserving order among the vanquished
peoples, and at the same time of protecting them from the attacks
of adjacent tribes; these representatives of the central power were
supported by garrisons, and were thus enabled to put down such minor
insurrections as broke out from time to time. Some of these
provinces were already in existence in the reigns of Shalmaneser or
Tiglath-pileser I.; after the reverses in the time of Assurirba, their
number decreased, but it grew rapidly again as Assur-nazir-pal and
Shalmaneser III. gradually extended the field of their operations and of
their victories. From this epoch onwards, the monuments mention over a
score of them, in spite of the fact that the list thus furnished is
not a complete one; the provinces of which we know most are those whose
rulers were successively appointed to act as <i>limmi</i>, each of them
giving their name to a year of a reign. Assyria proper contained at
least four, viz. Assur (called <i>the country</i>, as distinguished from all
others), Calah, Nineveh, and Arbela. The basin of the Lesser Zab was
divided into the provinces of Kakzi, Arrapkha, and Akhizukhîna;* that of
the Upper Tigris into those of Amidi, Tushkhân, and Gôzan. Kirruri was
bounded by Mazamua, and Mazamua by Arrapkha and Lake Urumiah. We hear
of the three spheres of Nazibina (Nisibis), Tela, and Kazappa in
Mesopotamia,** the two former on the southern watersheds of the Masios,
on the highways leading into Syria; the latter to the south of the
Euphrates, in the former kingdom of the Laqî.
</p>
<pre>
     * Akhizukhîna is probably identical with Arzukhîna = "the
     City of Zukhma," which is referred to as being situated in
     the basin of the Lesser Zab.

     ** Razappa is the biblical Rezeph (2 Kings xix. 12; Isa.
     xxxvii. 12) and the Resapha of Ptolemy, now Er-Rasafa, to
     the south of the Euphrates, on one of the routes leading to
     Palmyra.
</pre>
<p>
Most of them included&mdash;in addition to the territory under the immediate
control of the governor&mdash;a number of vassal states, kingdoms, cities,
and tribes, which enjoyed a certain measure of independence, but were
liable to pay tribute and render military service.

Each new country was annexed, as soon as conquered, to the nearest
province, or, if necessary, was converted into a distinct province by
itself; thus we find that Assur-nazir-pal, after laying hands on the
upper valleys of the Radanu and the Turnat, rebuilt the ruined city of
Atlîla, re-named it Dur-Assur, placed a commandant, cavalry, and
eunuchs there, and established within it storehouses for the receipt
of contributions from the neighbouring barbarians. He followed the
same course on each occasion when the fortune of war brought him fresh
subjects;* and his successors, Shalmaneser III., Samsi-rammân IV.,
and Rammân-nirâri did the same thing in Media, in Asia Minor, and in
Northern Syria;** Tiglath-pileser III. had only to follow their example
and extend the application of their system to the countries which he
gradually forced to submit to his rule.***

     at Tush-khân, in Naîri, and in the country of the Patina.

     ** The territory of the Bit-Adini was converted into a
     province by Shalmaneser III.

     *** We find the formation of an Aramæan province, with Kar-
     Assur as its capital, mentioned in the <i>Annals of Tiglatli-
     pileser III</i>. Provinces were also established in Media, in
     Unki, in the basin of the Orontes, and in Lebanon, from
     nineteen districts formerly belonging to Hamath, six
     maritime provinces in Northern Phoenicia and in Coele-Syria,
     in Galilee, at Gaza.

<p>
In his case, however, certain elements came into play which forced him
to modify several of their methods, and to have recourse to others
which they had seldom or never employed. The majority of the countries
hitherto incorporated had been near enough to the capital&mdash;whether it
were Assur, Calah, or Nineveh&mdash;to permit of strict watch being kept for
any sign of disaffection, and they could be promptly recalled to order
if they attempted to throw off the yoke. These provinces were, moreover,
of moderate area and sparsely populated: once drawn within the orbit of
Assyria's attraction, they were unable to escape from its influence by
their own unaided efforts; on the contrary, they gradually lost their
individuality, and ended by becoming merged in the body of the nation.
The Aramaean tribes of the Khabur and the Balikh, the Cossæans of the
Turnat, the marauding shepherds of the Gordyæan hills and the slopes
of the Masios, gradually became assimilated to their conquerors after
a more or less protracted resistance, till at length&mdash;in spite of
differences of origin, creed, and speech&mdash;they became the best of
Assyrians, every whit as devoted to the person of their king and as
jealous of his honour as the aboriginal Assyrians themselves. A similar
result could not be looked for in the case of the cities recently
subdued. It was not to be expected that Babylon and Damascus&mdash;to name
but two of the most important&mdash;would allow themselves to be influenced
and to become reconciled to their lot by artifices which had been
successful enough with the Medes and in the country of Tul-Abnî.
</p>
<p>
To take the case of Babylon first. It was no mere conglomeration of
tribes, nor a state of minor importance, but an actual empire, nearly as
large as that of Assyria itself, and almost as solidly welded together.
It extended from the Turnat and the mountains of Blam to the Arabian
desert and the Nâr-Marratûtn, and even though the Cossæans, Elamites,
Kaldâ, Sumerians, Akkadians, and other remnants of ancient peoples who
formed its somewhat motley population, had dwelt there for centuries in
a state of chronic discord, they all agreed&mdash;in theory, at any rate&mdash;in
recognising the common suzerainty of Babylon. Babylon was, moreover, by
general acknowledgment, the ancient metropolis to which Assyria owed its
whole civilisation; it was the holy city whose gods and whose laws had
served as a prototype for the gods and laws of Assyria; from its temples
and its archives the Assyrian scribes had drawn such knowledge as they
had of the history of the ancient world, their religious doctrines and
ceremonies, their methods of interpreting the omens and of forecasting
the future&mdash;in short, their whole literature, both sacred and profane.
The King of Nineveh might conquer Babylon, might even enter within its
gates in the hour of triumph, and, when once he had it at his
mercy, might throw down its walls, demolish its palaces, destroy its
<i>ziggurât</i>, burn its houses, exterminate or carry off its inhabitants,
and blot out its name from the list of nations; but so long as he
recoiled from the sacrilege involved in such irreparable destruction,
he was not merely powerless to reduce it to the level of an ordinary
leading provincial town, such as Tela or Tushkhân, but he could not
even deprive it in any way of its rank as a capital, or hope to make it
anything less than the second city of his empire. As long as it remained
in existence, it necessarily took precedence of all others, thanks to
its extensive area, the beauty and antiquity of its buildings, and the
number of its inhabitants. The pride of its nobles and priests, subdued
for a moment by defeat, would almost instantly have reasserted itself,
had the victor sought to lower the dignity of their city; Babylon
only consented to accept an alien master provided he bowed himself
respectfully before its superiority, and was willing to forget that he
was a stranger within its gates, and was ready to comply with its laws
and masquerade as a Babylonian. Tiglath-pileser III. never dreamt,
therefore, of treating the Babylonians as slaves, or of subordinating
them to their Assyrian descendants, but left their liberties and
territory alike unimpaired. He did not attempt to fuse into a single
empire the two kingdoms which his ability had won for him; he kept them
separate, and was content to be monarch of both on similar terms. He
divided himself, as it were, into two persons, one of whom reigned in
Calah, while the other reigned in Karduniash, and his Chaldæan subjects
took care to invest this dual <i>rôle</i> &mdash;based on a fiction so soothing
to their pride&mdash;with every appearance of reality; he received from them,
together with all the titles of the Babylonian kings, that name of Pulu,
which later on found its way into their chronicles, and which was so
long a puzzle to historians, both ancient and modern. Experience amply
proved that this was the only means by which it was possible to yoke
temporarily together the two great powers of the Euphrates and the
Tigris. Among the successors of Tiglath-pileser, the only sovereigns
to rule over Babylon without considerable difficulty were those who
followed the precedent set by him and were satisfied to divide their
functions and reign as dual kings over a dual kingdom.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This was so in the case of Tiglath-pileser III.'s
     immediate successor, Shalmaneser V., of Esarhaddon, and of
     Assur-bani-pal; Shalmaneser was known at Babylon by the name
     of Ululai, Assur-bani-pal by that of Kanda-lanu.
</pre>
<p>
This combination, while gratifying to the ambition of its rulers, was,
perhaps, more a source of loss than of gain to Assyria itself. It is
true that the power of Karduniash had decreased under the previous
dynasty, but it had still been strong enough to hold back the Aramæans
of the Persian Gulf on one side, and the Elamite hordes on the other. It
lay like a broad barrier between these barbarians and the cities of the
Middle Tigris; when an unusually vigorous attack compelled it to give
way at some point, it appealed to Nineveh for help, and an Assyrian
army, entering the country at the fords of the Zab, hastened to drive
back the aggressors to the place from which they had set out. When,
however, the kings of Assyria had become kings of Babylon as well, the
situation was altered. Several branches of the Kaldâ had hitherto held
possession of the city, and still possessed representatives and allies
among the other tribes, especially among the Bît-Yakîn, who believed
themselves entitled to reassert their supremacy within in. The Elamite
princes, on their part, accustomed to descend at will into the plains
that lay between the Tigris and the Euphrates, and to enrich themselves
by frequent raids, could not make up their minds to change the habits of
centuries, until they had at least crossed swords with the new despot,
and put his mettle to the test. The Ninevite King of Babylon was thus
in duty bound to protect his subjects against the same enemies that had
ceaselessly harassed his native-born predecessors, and as the unaided
resources of Karduniash no longer enabled him to do so effectively, he
was, naturally, obliged to fall back on the forces at his disposal as
King of Assyria. Henceforward it was no longer the Babylonian army
that protected Nineveh, but rather that of Nineveh which had to protect
Babylon, and to encounter, almost every year, foes whom in former days
it had met only at rare intervals, and then merely when it chose to
intervene in their affairs. Where the Assyrian sovereigns had gained a
kingdom for themselves and their posterity, Assyria itself found little
else but fresh battle-fields and formidable adversaries, in the effort
to overcome whom its energies were all but exhausted. In Syria and on
the shores of the Mediterranean, Tiglath-pileser had nations of less
stubborn vitality to deal with, nor was he bound by the traditions of a
common past to show equal respect to their prejudices. Arpad, Unki,
the Bekâa, Damascus, and Gilead were all consecutively swallowed up by
Assyria, but, the work of absorption once completed, difficulties were
encountered which now had to be met for the first time. The subordinate
to whom he entrusted the task of governing these districts* had one
or two Assyrian regiments assigned him as his body-guard,** and these
exercised the same ascendency over the natives as the Egyptian archers
had done in days gone by: it was felt that they had the whole might of
Assyria behind them, and the mere fact of their presence in the midst of
the conquered country was, as a rule, sufficient to guarantee the safety
of the Assyrian governor and ensure obedience to his commands.
</p>
<pre>
     * The governor was called <i>Shaknu</i> = "he whom the king has
     established in his place," and <i>pekhu</i> = "the pilot," "the
     manager," whence <i>pikhatu</i> = "a district," and <i>bel-pikhati</i>
     = "the master of a district." It seems that the <i>shaknu</i> was
     of higher rank than the <i>bel-pikhati</i>, and often had the
     latter under his command.

     ** Thus Assur-nazir-pal selected the horsemen and other
     soldiers who were to form the body-guard of the governor of
     Parzindu.
</pre>
<p>
This body-guard was never a very numerous one, for the army would have
melted away in the course of a campaign or two, had it been necessary,
after each fresh conquest, to detach from it a sufficient force to
guard against rebellion. It was strengthened, it is true, by auxiliaries
enlisted on the spot, and the tributary chiefs included in the
provincial district were expected to furnish a reasonable quota of men
in case of need;* but the loyalty of all these people was, at the best,
somewhat doubtful, and in the event of their proving untrustworthy at
a critical moment, the little band of Assyrian horse and foot would be
left to deal with the revolt unaided until such time as the king could
come and relieve them.
</p>
<pre>
     * In a despatch from Belibni to Assur-bani-pal we find
     Aramæans from the Persian Gulf submitting to the authority
     of an Assyrian officer, and fighting in Elam side by side
     with his troops. Again, under Assur-bani-pal, an army sent
     to repress a revolt on the part of Kedar and the Nabatseans
     included contingents from Ammon, Moab, and Edom, together
     with the Assyrian garrisons of the Haurân and Zobah.
</pre>
<p>
The distance between the banks of the Jordan or Abana and those of the
Tigris was a long one, and in nearly every instance it would have been
a question of months before help could arrive. Meanwhile, Egypt was at
hand, jealous of her rival, who was thus encroaching on territory which
had till lately been regarded as her exclusive sphere of influence, and
vaguely apprehensive of the fate which might be in store for her if some
Assyrian army, spurred by the lust of conquest, were to cross the desert
and bear down upon the eastern frontiers of the Delta. Distrustful of
her own powers, and unwilling to assume a directly offensive attitude,
she did all she could to foment continual disturbances among the Hebrews
and Phoenicians, as well as in Philistia and Aram; she carried on secret
intrigues with the independent princes, and held out tempting hopes
of speedy intervention before the eyes of their peoples; her influence
could readily be traced in every seditious movement. The handful of men
assigned to the governors of the earlier provinces close to the capital
would have been of little avail against perils of this kind. Though
Tiglath-pileser added colony to colony in the distant regions annexed by
him, he organised them on a different plan from that which had prevailed
before his time. His predecessors had usually sent Assyrians to these
colonies, and filled the villages vacated by them with families taken
from the conquered region: a transfer of inhabitants was made, for
instance, from Naîri or from Media into Assyria, and <i>vice versâ</i>. By
following this system, Tiglath-pileser would soon have scattered his
whole people over the dependencies of his empire, and have found his
hereditary states peopled by a motley and incoherent collection of
aliens; he therefore left his Assyrians for the most part at home, and
only effected exchanges between captives. In his earlier campaigns
he brought back with him, on one occasion, 65,000 prisoners from the
table-land of Iran, in order to distribute them over a province which
he was organising on the banks of the Turnat and the Zab: he levied
contributions of this kind without mercy from all the states that he
conquered from year to year, and dispersed the captives thus obtained
over the length and breadth of his empire; he transplanted the Aramæans
of the Mesopotamian deserts, and the Kaldâ to the slopes of Mount Amanus
or the banks of the Orontes, the Patinians and Hamathæans to Ulluba,
the inhabitants of Damascus to Kîr or to the borders of Elam,* and the
Israelites to some place in Assyria.**

He allowed them to take with them their wives and their children, their
herds, their chattels, their gods, and even their money. Drafted into
the towns and country districts in batches sufficiently numerous to
be self-supporting, but yet not large enough to allow of their at once
re-establishing themselves as a distinct nation in their new home, they
seem to have formed, even in the midst of the most turbulent provinces,
settlements of colonists who lived unaffected by any native influence or
resentment. The aborigines hated them because of their religion, their
customs, their clothing, and their language; in their eyes they
were mere interlopers, who occupied the property of relations or
fellow-countrymen who had fallen in battle or had been spirited away to
the other end of the world. And even when, after many years, the native
owners of the soil had become familiarised with them, this mutual
antipathy had struck such deep root in their minds that any
understanding between the natives and the descendants of the immigrants
was quite out of the question: what had been formerly a vast kingdom,
occupied by a single homogeneous race, actuated by a common patriotic
spirit, became for many a year a region capriciously subdivided and torn
by the dissensions of a number of paltry antagonistic communities.
The colonists, exposed to the same hatreds as the original Assyrian
conquerors, soon forgot to look upon the latter as the oppressors of
all, and, allowing their present grudge to efface the memory of past
injuries, did not hesitate to make common cause with them. In time of
peace, the governor did his best to protect them against molestation on
the part of the natives, and in return for this they rallied round him
whenever the latter threatened to get out of hand, and helped him
to stifle the revolt or hold it in check until the arrival of
reinforcements. Thanks to their help, the empire was consolidated and
maintained without too many violent outbreaks in regions far removed
from the capital and beyond the immediate reach of the sovereign.* We
possess very few details with regard to the administration of these
prefects.**

     the precise nature of which it is not easy to ascertain,
     e.g. the Khâzanu, the Labuttu, and others. One of them,
     apparently, should be read <i>Shuparshak</i>, and identical with
     one of the titles mentioned in Ezra (v. 6, vi. 6) as being
     in existence during the Persian epoch.

<p>
The various functionaries, governors of towns, tax-collectors, heads of
stations, and officers whose duty it was to patrol the roads and look
after the safety of merchants, were, for the most part, selected from
among natives who had thrown in their lot with Assyria, and probably
few Assyrians were to be found outside the more turbulent cities and
important fortresses. The kings and chiefs whose territory was attached
to a given province, either took their instructions direct from Nineveh,
or were sometimes placed under the control of a resident, or <i>kipu</i>,
with some sort of escort at his back, who kept watch over their
movements and reported them to the suzerain, and saw that the tribute
was paid regularly, and that the military service provided for in the
treaties was duly rendered. Governors and residents alike kept up a
constant correspondence with the court, and such of their letters as
have chanced to come down to us show what a minute account of even
the most trifling occurrences was required of them by the central
authorities. They were not only obliged to report any fluctuation in
the temper or attitude of their subordinates, or any intrigues that
were being entered into across the frontier; they had also to record the
transfer of troops, the return of fugitives, the pursuit of deserters,
any chance scuffle between soldiers and natives, as well as the
punishment inflicted on the rebellious, the appearance of a portent
in the heavens, or omens noticed by the augurs. There were plenty
of envious or officious tongues among their followers to report to
headquarters the slightest failure of duty, and to draw attention to
their negligence. Moreover, it seems certain that the object of thus
compelling them to refer to the king at every turn, was not merely in
order to keep him informed of all that took place in his dependencies,
but also to lay bare the daily life of his prefects before his eyes.
The latter were entrusted with the command of seasoned troops; they had
considerable sums of money passing through their hands, and were often
obliged to take prompt decisions and enter into diplomatic or military
transactions on their own responsibility; in short, most of them, at
any rate, who were stationed at the furthest confines of the empire were
really kings in all but title, insignia, and birth. There was always the
danger lest some among them should be tempted to reassert, in their own
interest, the independence of the countries under their rule, and seek
to found a dynasty in their midst. The strict supervision maintained
over these governors generally nipped any ambition of this kind in the
bud; in some cases, however, it created the very danger it was intended
to prevent. If a governor who had been recalled to Nineveh or Calah in
order to explain his conduct failed to clear himself completely, he at
once fell into disgrace; and disgrace in Assyria, as in other countries
of the East, meant, nine times out of ten, confiscation of property,
mutilation and lifelong imprisonment, or death in its most hideous form.
He would, therefore, think twice before quitting his post, and if he
had any reason to suppose himself suspected, or viewed with disfavour in
high quarters, he would be in no hurry to obey a summons to the capital.
A revolt was almost certain to be crushed without fail, and offered
merely a very precarious chance of escape, but the governor was seldom
likely to hesitate between almost certain condemnation and the vague
possibility of a successful rising; in such a case, therefore, he staked
everything on a single throw.
</p>



<p>
The system was a defective on, in that it exposed to strong temptation
the very functionaries whose loyalty was most essential to the proper
working of the administration, but its dangers were out weighed by
such important advantages that we cannot but regard it as a very real
improvement on the haphazard methods of the past. In the first place,
it opened up a larger recruiting-ground for the army, and, in a measure,
guaranteed it against that premature exhaustion which had already led
more than once to an eclipse of the Assyrian power. It may be that the
pick of these provincial troops were, preferably, told off for police
duties, or for the defence of the districts in which they were levied,
and that they seldom left it except to do battle in the adjacent
territory;* but, even with these limitations they were none the less
of inestimable value, since they relieved the main army of Assyria from
garrison duties in a hundred scattered localities, and allowed the king
to concentrate it almost in its entirety about his own person, and
to direct it <i>en masse</i> upon those points where he wished to strike a
decisive blow.
</p>
<pre>
     * Thus, in the reign of Assur-bani-pal, we find the militia
     of the governor of Uruk marching to battle against the
     Gambulu.
</pre>
<p>
On the other hand, the finances of the kingdom were put on a more
stable and systematic basis. For nearly the whole of the two previous
centuries, during which Assyria had resumed its victorious career, the
treasury had been filled to some extent by taxes in kind or in money,
and by various dues claimed from the hereditary kingdom and its few
immediate dependencies, but mainly by booty and by tribute levied after
each campaign from the peoples who had been conquered or had voluntarily
submitted to Assyrian rule. The result was a budget which fluctuated
greatly, since all forays were not equally lucrative, and the new
dependencies proved so refractory at the idea of perpetual tribute, that
frequent expeditions were necessary in order to persuade them to pay
their dues. We do not know how Tiglath-pileser III. organised the
finances of his provinces, but certain facts recorded here and there in
the texts show that he must have drawn very considerable amounts from
them. We notice that twenty or thirty years after his time, Carchemish
was assessed at a hundred talents, Arpad and Kuî at thirty each, Megiddo
and Manzuatu at fifteen, though the purposes to which these sums were
applied is not specified.

On the other hand, we know the precise object to which the contributions
of several other cities were assigned; as, for instance, so much for the
maintenance of the throne in the palace, or for the divans of the ladies
of the harem; so much for linen garments, for dresses, and for veils;
twenty talents from Nineveh for the armaments of the fleet, and ten from
the same city for firewood. Certain provinces were expected to maintain
the stud-farms, and their contributions of horses were specially
valuable, now that cavalry played almost as important a part as infantry
in military operations. The most highly prized animals came, perhaps,
from Asia Minor; the nations of Mount Taurus, who had supplied chargers
to Israel and Egypt five centuries earlier, now furnished war-horses
to the squadrons of Nineveh. The breed was small, but robust, inured to
fatigue and hard usage, and in every way similar to that raised in these
countries at the present day. In war, horses formed a very considerable
proportion of the booty taken; in time of peace, they were used as part
of the payment of the yearly tribute, and a brisk trade in them was
carried on with Mesopotamia.

After the king had deducted from his receipts enough to provide amply
for the wants of his family and court, the salaries of the various
functionaries and officials, the pay and equipment of his army, the
maintenance and construction of palaces and fortresses, he had still
sufficient left over to form an enormous reserve fund on which he and
his successors might draw in the event of their ordinary sources of
income being depleted by a series of repeated reverses.

Tiglath-pileser thus impressed upon Assyria the character by which
it was known during the most splendid century of its history, and the
organisation which he devised for it was so admirably adapted to the
Oriental genius that it survived the fall of Nineveh, and served as a
model for every empire-maker down to the close of the Macedonian era and
even beyond it.
</p>


<p>
The wealth of the country grew rapidly, owing to the influx of capital
and of foreign population; in the intervals between their campaigns
its rulers set to work to remove all traces of the ruins which had been
allowed to accumulate during the last forty years. The king had
built himself a splendid palace at Calah, close to the monuments
of Assur-nazir-pal and Shalmaneser III., and its terraces and walls
overhung the waters of the Tigris. The main entrance consisted of a
<i>Bît-khilâni</i>, one of those porticoes, flanked by towers and supported
by columns or pillars, often found in Syrian towns, the fashion for
which was now beginning to spread to Western Asia.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The precise nature of the edifices referred to in the
     inscriptions under the name of Bît-khilâni is still a matter
     of controversy. It has been identified with the pillared
     hall, or audience-chamber, such as we find in Sargon's
     palace at Khorsabad, and with edifices or portions of
     edifices which varied according to the period, but which
     were ornamented with columns. It seems clear, however, that
     it was used of the whole series of chambers and buildings
     which formed the monumental gates of Assyrian palaces,
     something analogous to the <i>Migdol</i> of Ramses III. at
     Medinet-Habu, and more especially to the gates at Zinjirli.
</pre>
<p>
Those discovered at Zinjirli afford fine examples of the arrangements
adopted in buildings of this kind; the lower part of the walls was
covered with bas-reliefs, figures of gods and men, soldiers mounted or
on foot, victims and fantastic animal shapes; the columns, where there
were any, rested on the back of a sphinx or on a pair of griffins of a
type which shows a curious mixture of Egyptian and Semitic influences.

<p>
The wood-work of the Ninevite Bît-khilâni was of cedar from Mount
Amanus, the door-frames and fittings were of various rare woods, inlaid
with ivory and metal. The entrance was guarded by the usual colossal
figures, and the walls of the state reception-rooms were covered with
slabs of alabaster; on these, in accordance with the usual custom,* were
carved scenes from the royal wars, with explanatory inscriptions.
The palace was subsequently dismantled, its pictures defaced and its
inscriptions obliterated,** to mark the hatred felt by later generations
towards the hero whom they were pleased to regard as a usurper; we can
only partially succeed in deciphering his annals by the help of the
fragmentary sentences which have escaped the fury of the destroyer.
</p>
<pre>
     * The building of Tiglath-pileser's palace is described in
     the Nimroud Inscription. It stood near the centre of the
     platform of Nimroud.

     ** The materials were utilised by Esarhaddon, but it does
     not necessarily follow that the palace was dismantled by
     that monarch; this was probably done by Sargon or by
     Sennacherib.

The cities and fortresses which he raised throughout the length and
breadth of Assyria proper and its more recently acquired provinces have
similarly disappeared; we can only conjecture that the nobles of his
court, fired by his example, must have built and richly endowed more
than one city on their hereditary estates, or in the territories under
their rule. Bel-harrân-beluzur, the marshal of the palace, who twice
gave his name to years of the king's reign, viz. in 741 and 727 B.C.,
possessed, it would seem, an important fief a little to the north
of Assur, near the banks of the Tharthar, on the site of the present
Tel-Abta. The district was badly cultivated, and little better than a
wilderness; by express order of the celestial deities&mdash;Marduk, Nabu,
Shamash, Sin, and the two Ishtars&mdash;he dug the foundations of a city
which he called Dur-Bel-harrân-beluzur. The description he gives of it
affords conclusive evidence of the power of the great nobles, and shows
how nearly they approached, by their wealth and hereditary privileges,
to the kingly rank. He erected, we are told, a <i>ziggurât</i> on a raised
terrace, in which he placed his gods in true royal fashion; he assigned
slaves, landed property, and a yearly income to their priests, in order
that worship might be paid to them in perpetuity; he granted sanctuary
to all freemen who settled within the walls or in the environs,
exemption from forced labour, and the right to tap a water-course and
construct a canal. A decree of foundation was set up in the temple in
memory of Bel-harrân-beluzur, precisely as if he were a crowned king.
It is a stele of common grey stone with a circular top. The dedicator
stands erect against the background of the carving, bare-foot and
bare-headed, his face cleanshaven, dressed in a long robe embroidered in
a chessboard pattern, and with a tunic pleated in horizontal rows; his
right elbow is supported by the left hand, while the right is raised
to a level with his eyes, his fist is clenched, and the thumb inserted
between the first and second fingers in the customary gesture of
adoration.
</p>

<p>
What the provost of the palace had done on his land, the other barons in
all probability did on theirs; most of the departments which had fallen
away and languished during the disturbances at the close of the previous
dynasty, took a new lease of life under their protection. Private
documents&mdash;which increase in number as the century draws to an
end&mdash;contracts, official reports, and letters of scribes, all give us
the impression of a wealthy and industrious country, stirred by the most
intense activity, and in the enjoyment of unexampled prosperity. The
excellent administration of Tiglath-pileser and his nobles had paved the
way for this sudden improvement, and had helped to develop it, and
when Shalmaneser V. succeeded his father on the throne it continued
unchecked.* The new-comer made no changes in the system of government
which had been so ably inaugurated. He still kept Assyria separate from
Karduniash; his Babylonian subjects, faithful to ancient custom,
soon devised a nickname for him, that of Ululai, as though seeking to
persuade themselves that they had a king who belonged to them alone; and
it is under this name that their annalists have inscribed him next to
Pulu in the list of their dynasties.**
</p>

<p>
    His reign was, on the whole, a calm and peaceful one; the Kaldâ, the
Medes, Urartu, and the races of Mount Taurus remained quiet, or, at any
rate, such disorders as may have arisen among them were of too trifling
a nature to be deemed worthy of notice in the records of the time.
Syria alone was disturbed, and several of its independent states
took advantage of the change of rulers to endeavour to shake off the
authority of Assyria.
</p>
<pre>
     * It was, for a long time, an open question with the earlier
     Assyriologists whether or not Shalmaneser and Sargon were
     different names for one and the same monarch. As for
     monuments, we possess only one attributed to Shalmaneser, a
     weight in the form of a lion, discovered by Layard at Nimroud,
     in the north-west palace. The length of his reign, and
     the scanty details we possess concerning it, have been
     learnt from the <i>Eponym Canon</i> and <i>Pinches' Babylonian
     Chronicle</i>, and also from the Hebrew texts (2 Kings xvii. 3-
     6; xviii. 9-12).

     ** The identity of Ululai and Shalmaneser V., though still
     questioned by Oppert, has been proved by the comparison of
     Babylonian records, in some of which the names Pulu and
     Ululai occur in positions exactly corresponding with those
     occupied, in others, by Tiglath-pileser and Shalmaneser. The
     name Ululai was given to the king because he was born in the
     month of Ulul; in Pinches' list we find a gloss, "Dynasty
     of Tinu," which probably indicates the Assyrian town in
     which Tiglath-pileser III. and his son were born.
</pre>
<p>
Egypt continued to give them secret encouragement in these tactics,
though its own internal dissensions prevented it from offering any
effective aid. The Tanite dynasty was in its death-throes. Psamuti, the
last of its kings, exercised a dubious sovereignty over but a few of the
nomes on the Arabian frontier.*
</p>
<pre>
     * He is the Psammous mentioned by Manetho. The cartouches
     attributed to him by Lepsius really belong to the Psammuthis
     of the XXIXth dynasty. It is possible that one of the marks
     found at Karnak indicating the level of the Nile belong to
     the reign of this monarch.
</pre>
<p>
His neighbours the Saites were gradually gaining the upper hand in the
Delta and in the fiefs of middle Egypt, at first under Tafnakhti, and
then, after his death, under his son Bukunirînif, Bocchoris of the
Greek historians. They held supremacy over several personages who, like
themselves, claimed the title and rank of Pharaoh; amongst others, over
a certain Rudamanu Mîamun, son of Osorkon: their power did not, however,
extend beyond Siut, near the former frontier of the Theban kingdom.
The withdrawal of Piônkhi-Mîamun, and his subsequent death, had not
disturbed the Ethiopian rule in the southern half of Egypt, though it
somewhat altered its character. While an unknown Ethiopian king filled
the place of the conquerer at Napata, another Ethiopian, named Kashta,
made his way to the throne in Thebes.

<p>
It is possible that he was a son of Piônkhi, and may have been placed in
supreme power by his father when the latter reinstated the city in
its place as capital. With all their partiality for real or supposed
descendants of the Ramesside dynasty, the Thebans were, before all
things, proud of their former greatness, and eagerly hoped to regain it
without delay. When, therefore, they accepted this Kushite king who, to
their eyes, represented the only family possessed of a legitimate claim
to the throne, it was mainly because they counted on him to restore them
to their former place among the cities of Egypt. They must have been
cruelly disappointed when he left them for the Sacred Mountain. His
invasion, far from reviving their prosperity, merely served to ratify
the suppression of that pontificate of Amon-Râ which was the last
remaining evidence of their past splendour.
</p>




<p>
All hope of re-establishing it had now to be abandoned, since the
sovereign who had come to them from Napata was himself by birth and
hereditary privelege and hereditary sole priest of Anion: in his
absence the actual head of the Theban religion could lay claim only to
an inferior office, and indeed, even then, the only reason for accepting
a second prophet was that he might direct the worship of the temple
at Karnak. The force of circumstances compelled the Ethiopians to
countenance in the Thebaid what their Tanite or Bubastite predecessors
had been obliged to tolerate at Hermopolis, Heracleopolis, Sais, and in
many another lesser city; they turned it into a feudatory kingdom, and
gave it a ruler who, like Auîti, half a century earlier, had the right
to use the cartouches. Once installed, Kashta employed the usual methods
to secure his seat on the throne, one of the first being a marriage
alliance. The disappearance of the high priests had naturally increased
the importance of the princesses consecrated to the service of Amon.
From henceforward they were the sole visible intermediaries between the
god and his people, the privileged guardians of his body and his double,
and competent to perpetuate the line of the solar kings. The Theban
appanage constituted their dowry, and even if their sex prevented
them from discharging all those civil, military, and religious duties
required by their position, no one else had the right to do so on their
behalf, unless he was expressly chosen by them for the purpose. When
once married they deputed their husbands to act for them; so long as
they remained either single or widows, some exalted personage, the
prophet of Amon or Montu, the ruler of Thebes, or the administrator
of the Said, managed their houses and fiefs for them with such show of
authority that strangers were at times deceived, and took him for the
reigning monarch of the country.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Thus Harua, in the time of Amenertas, was prince and chief
     over the servants of the "Divine Worshipper." Mantumihâit,
     in the time of Taharqa and of Tanuatamanu, was ruler of
     Thebes, and fourth prophet of Amon, and it is he who is
     described in the Assyrian monuments as King of Thebes.
</pre>
<p>
The Pharaohs had, therefore, a stronger incentive than ever to secure
exclusive possession of these women, and if they could not get all of
them safely housed in their harems, they endeavoured, at any rate, to
reserve for themselves the chief among them, who by purity of descent or
seniority in age had attained the grade of <i>Divine Worshipper</i>. Kashta
married a certain Shapenuapît, daughter of Osorkon III. and a Theban
pallacide;* it is uncertain whether he eventually became king over
Ethiopia and the Sudan or not. So far, we have no proof that he did,
but it seems quite possible when we remember that one of his children,
Shabaku (Sabaco), subsequently occupied the throne of Napata in addition
to that of Thebes. Kashta does not appear to have possessed sufficient
energy to prevent the Delta and its nomes from repudiating the Ethiopian
supremacy. The Saites, under Tafnakhti or Bocchoris, soon got the upper
hand, and it was to them that the Syrian vassals of Nineveh looked
for aid, when death removed the conqueror who had trampled them so
ruthlessly underfoot. Ever since the fall of Arpad, Hadrach, and
Damascus, Shabaraîn, a town situated somewhere in the valley of the
Orontes or of the Upper Litany,** and hitherto but little known, had
served as a rallying-point for the disaffected Aramaean tribes: on
the accession of Shalmaneser V. it ventured to rebel, probably in 727
B.C., but was overthrown and destroyed, its inhabitants being led away
captive.
</p>
<pre>
     * It may be that, in accordance with a custom which obtained
     during the generations that followed, and which possibly
     originated about this period, this daughter of Osorkon III.
     was only the adoptive mother of Amenertas.

     ** Shabaraîn was originally confounded with Samaria by the
     early commentators on the Babylonian Chronicle. Halévy, very
     happily, referred it to the biblical Sepharvaîm, a place
     always mentioned in connection with Hamath and Arpad (2
     Kings xvii. 24, 31; xviii. 34; xix. 13: cf. Isa. xxxvi. 19;
     xxxvii. 13), and to the Sibraim of Ezekiel (xlvii. 16),
     called in the <i>Septuagint</i> Samarêim. Its identification with
     Samaria has, since then, been generally rejected, and its
     connection with Sibraim admitted. Sibraim (or Sepharvaîm, or
     Samarêîm) has been located at Shomerîyeh, to the east of the
     Bahr-Kades, and south of Hamath.
</pre>
<p>
This achievement proved, beyond the possibility of doubt, that in spite
of their change of rulers the vengeance of the Assyrians was as keen
and sharp as ever. Not one of the Syrian towns dared to stir, and the
Phonician seaports, though their loyalty had seemed, for a moment,
doubtful, took care to avoid any action which might expose them to the
terrors of a like severity.* The Israelites and Philistines, alone of
the western peoples, could not resign themselves to a prudent policy;
after a short period of hesitation they drew the sword from its
scabbard, and in 725 war broke out.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The siege of Tyre, which the historian Menander, in a
     passage quoted by Josephus, places in the reign of
     Shalmaneser, ought really to be referred to the reign of
     Sennacherib, or the fragment of Menander must be divided
     into three parts dealing with three different Assyrian
     campaigns against Tyre, under Tiglath-pileser, Sennacherib,
     and Esarhaddon respectively.

     ** The war cannot have begun earlier, for the <i>Eponym
     Canon</i>, in dealing with 726, has the words "in the country,"
     thus proving that no expedition took place in that year; in
     the case of the year 725, on the other hand, it refers to a
     campaign against some country whose name has disappeared.
     The passages in the <i>Book of Kings</i> (2 Kings xvii. 1-6, and
     xviii. 9-12) which deal with the close of the kingdom of
     Israel, have been interpreted in such a way as to give us
     two campaigns by Shalmaneser against Hoshea: (1) Hoshea
     having failed to pay the tribute imposed upon him by
     Tiglath-pileser, Shalmaneser made war upon him and compelled
     him to resume its payment (2 Kings xvii. 1-3); (2) Hoshea
     having intrigued with Egypt, and declined to pay tribute,
     Shalmaneser again took the field against him, made him
     prisoner, and besieged Samaria for three years (2 Kings
     xvii. 4-6; xviii. 9-12). The first expedition must, in this
     case, have taken place in 727, while the second must have
     lasted from 725-722. Most modern historians believe that the
     Hebrew writer has ascribed to Shalmaneser the subjection of
     Hoshea which was really the act of Tiglath-pileser, as well
     as the final war against Israel. According to Winckler, the
     two portions of the narrative must have been borrowed from
     two different versions of the final war, which the final
     editor inserted one after the other, heedless of the
     contradictions contained in them.
</pre>
<p>
Hoshea, who had ascended the throne with the consent of Tiglath-pileser,
was unable to keep them quiet. The whole of Galilee and Gilead was now
an Assyrian province, subject to the governor of Damascus; Jerusalem,
Moab, Ammon, and the Bedâwin had transferred their allegiance to
Nineveh; and Israel, with merely the central tribes of Ephraim,
Manasseh, and Benjamin left, was now barely equal in area and population
to Judah. Their tribute weighed heavily on the Israelites; passing
armies had laid waste their fields, and townsmen, merchants, and nobles
alike, deprived of their customary resources, fretted with impatience
under the burdens and humiliations imposed on them by their defeat;
convinced of their helplessness, they again looked beyond their own
borders for some nation or individual who should restore to them their
lost prosperity. Amid the tottering fortunes of their neighbours, Egypt
alone stood erect, and it was, therefore, to Egypt that they turned
their eyes. Negotiations were opened, not with Pharaoh himself, but
with Shabi, one of the petty kings on the eastern frontier of the Delta,
whose position made him better qualified than any other to deal with
Syrian affairs.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This individual is called Sua, Seveh, and So in the Hebrew
     text (2 Kings xvii. 4), and the Septuagint gives the
     transliteration Sebek side by side with Sêgôs. He is found
     again under the forms Shibahi, Shabi, Shabé, in Sargon's
     inscriptions.
</pre>
<p>
Hannon of Gaza had by this time returned from exile, and it was,
doubtless, owing to Shabi's support that he had been able to drive out
the Assyrian generals and recover his crown.* The Israelite aristocracy
was led away by his example, but Shalmaneser hastened to the spot before
the Egyptian bowmen had time to cross the isthmus. Hoshea begged
for mercy, and was deported into Assyria and condemned to lifelong
imprisonment.** Though deserted by her king, Samaria did not despair;
she refused to open her gates, and, being strongly fortified, compelled
the Assyrians to lay regular siege to the city. It would seem that at
one moment, at the beginning of operations, when it was rumoured on all
sides that Pharaoh would speedily intervene, Ahaz began to fear for his
own personal safety, and seriously considered whether it would not be
wiser to join forces with Israel or with Egypt.***
</p>
<pre>
     * This seems to be the inference from Sargon's inscription,
     in which he is referred to as relying on the army of Shabi,
     the <i>tartan</i> of Egypt.

     ** 2 Kings xvii. 4.

     *** The <i>Second Book of Kings</i> (xviii. 9,10; cf. xvii. 6)
     places the beginning of the siege of Samaria in the seventh
     year of Hoshea ( = fourth year of Hezekiah), and the capture
     of the town in the ninth year of Hoshea ( = sixth year of
     Hezekiah); further on it adds that Sennacherib's campaign
     against Hezekiah took place in the fourteenth year of the
     latter's reign (2 Kings xviii. 13; cf. Isa. xxxvi. 1). Now,
     Sennacherib's campaign against Hezekiah took place (as will
     be shown later on, in vol. viii. Chapter I.) in 702 B.C.,
     and Samaria was captured in 722. The synchronisms in the
     Hebrew narrative are therefore fictitious, and rest on no
     real historical basis&mdash;at any rate, in so far as the king
     who occupied the throne of Judah at the time of the fall of
     Samaria is concerned; Ahaz was still alive at that date, and
     continued to reign till 716 or 715, or perhaps only till
     720.

The rapid sequence of events, however, backed by the counsel of Isaiah,
speedily recalled him to a more reasonable view of the situation. The
prophet showed him Samaria spread out before him like one of those
wreaths of flowers which the guests at a banquet bind round their brows,
and which gradually fade as their wearers drink deeper and deeper. "Woe
to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading
flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley
of them that are overcome with wine. Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and
strong one; as a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, as a tempest
of mighty waters overflowing, shall be cast down to the earth with
violence. The crown of the pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be
trodden underfoot, and the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which
is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as the first ripe fig before
the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in
his hand he eateth it up." While the cruel fate of the perverse city was
being thus accomplished, Jahveh Sabaoth was to be a crown of glory to
those of His children who remained faithful to Him; but Judah, far from
submitting itself to His laws, betrayed Him even as Israel had done.
Its prophets and priests were likewise distraught with drunkenness; they
staggered under the effects of their potations, and turned to scorn the
true prophet sent to proclaim to them the will of Jehovah. "Whom," they
stammered between their hiccups&mdash;"whom will He teach knowledge? and whom
will He make to understand the message? them that are weaned from the
milk and drawn from the breasts? For it is precept upon precept, precept
upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little and there a
little!" And sure enough it was by the mouth of a stammering people, by
the lips of the Assyrians, that Jahveh was to speak to them. In vain did
the prophet implore them: "This is the rest, give ye rest to him that is
weary;" they did not listen to him, and now Jahveh turns their own gibes
against them: "Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon
line, line upon line, here a little and there a little,"&mdash;"that they may
go and fall backward, and be broken and snared and taken." There was to
be no hope of safety for Jerusalem unless it gave up all dependence on
human counsels, and trusted solely to God for protection.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Isa. xxviii. Giesebrecht has given it as his opinion that
     only verses 1-6, 23-29 of the prophecy were delivered at
     this epoch: the remainder he believes to have been written
     during Sennacherib's campaign against Judah, and suggests
     that the prophet added on his previous oracle to them, thus
     diverting it from its original application. Others, such as
     Stade and Wellhausen, regard the opening verses as embodying
     a mere rhetorical figure. Jerusalem, they say, appeared to
     the prophet as though changed into Samaria, and it is this
     transformed city which he calls "the crown of pride of the
     drunkards of Ephraim."
</pre>
<p>
Samaria was doomed; this was the general belief, and men went about
repeating it after Isaiah, each in his own words; every one feared lest
the disaster should spread to Judah also, and that Jahveh, having once
determined to have done with the northern kingdom, would turn His wrath
against that of the south as well. Micah the Morashtite, a prophet
born among the ranks of the middle class, went up and down the land
proclaiming misery to be the common lot of the two sister nations sprung
from the loins of Jacob, as a punishment for their common errors and
weaknesses. "The Lord cometh forth out of His place, and will come and
tread upon the high places of the earth. And the mountains shall be
molten under Him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before
the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place. For the
transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of
Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and
what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?" The doom
pronounced against Samaria was already being carried out, and soon the
hapless city was to be no more than "an heap of the field, and as the
plantings of a vineyard; and I will pour down the stones thereof into
the valley," saith the Lord, "and I will discover the foundations
thereof. And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and
all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay
desolate; for of the hire of an harlot hath she gathered them, and into
the hire of an harlot shall they return." Yet, even while mourning over
Samaria, the prophet cannot refrain from thinking of his own people, for
the terrible blow which had fallen on Israel "is come even unto Judah;
it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem." Doubtless
the Assyrian generals kept a watchful eye upon Ahaz during the whole
time of the siege, from 724 to 722, and when once the first heat of
enthusiasm had cooled, the presence of so formidable an army within
striking distance must have greatly helped the king to restrain the
ill-advised tendencies of some of his subjects. Samaria still held out
when Shalmaneser died at Babylon in the month of Tebeth, 722. Whether he
had no son of fit age to succeed him, or whether a revolution, similar
to that which had helped to place Tiglath-pileser on the throne, broke
out as soon as he had drawn his last breath, is not quite clear. At any
rate, Sargon, an officer who had served under him, was proclaimed king
on the 22nd day of Tebeth, and his election was approved by the whole
of Assyria. After some days of hesitation, Babylon declined to recognise
him, and took the oath of allegiance to a Kaldu named Marduk-abalidinna,
or Merodach-baladan. While these events were taking place in the heart
of the empire, Samaria succumbed; perhaps to famine, but more probably
to force. It was sacked and dismantled, and the bulk of its population,
amounting to 27,280 souls, were carried away into Mesopotamia and
distributed along the Balîkh, the Khabur, the banks of the river of
Gozân, and among the towns of the Median frontier.*

     * Sargon does not mention where he deported the Israelites
     to, but we learn this from the <i>Second Book of Kings</i> (xvii.
     6; xviii. 11). There has been much controversy as to whether
     Samaria was taken by Shalmanoser, as the Hebrew chronicler
     seems to believe (2 Kings xvii. 3-6; xviii. 9, 10), or by
     Sargon, as the Assyrian scribes assure us. At first, several
     scholars suggested a solution of the difficulty by arguing
     that Shalmaneser and Sargon were one and the same person;
     afterwards the theory took shape that Samaria was really
     captured in the reign of Shalmaneser, but by Sargon, who was
     in command of the besieging army at the time, and who
     transferred this achievement, of which he was naturally
     proud, to the beginning of his own reign. The simplest
     course seems to be to accept for the present the testimony
     of contemporary documents, and place the fall of Samaria at
     the beginning of the reign of Sargon, being the time
     indicated by Sargon in his inscriptions.

Sargon made the whole territory into a province; an Assyrian governor
was installed in the palace of the kings of Israel, and soon the altars
of the strange gods smoked triumphantly by the side of the altars of
Jahveh (722 B.C.).*

     occasion to refer farther on in the present volume. The

Thus fell Samaria, and with Samaria the kingdom of Israel, and with
Israel the last of the states which had aspired, with some prospect of
success, to rule over Syria. They had risen one after another during
the four centuries in which the absence of the stranger had left them
masters of their own fate&mdash;the Hittites in the North, the Hebrews and
the Philistines in the South, and the Aramæans and Damascus in the
centre; each one of these races had enjoyed its years of glory and
ambition in the course of which it had seemed to prevail over its
rivals. Then those whose territory lay at the extremities began to
feel the disadvantages of their isolated position, and after one or two
victories gave up all hope of ever establishing a supremacy over
the whole country. The Hittite sphere of influence never at any time
extended much further southwards than the sources of the Orontes, while
that of the Hebrews in their palmiest days cannot have gone beyond the
vicinity of Hamath. And even progress thus far had cost both Hebrews and
Hittites a struggle so exhausting that they could not long maintain
it. No sooner did they relax their efforts, than those portions of
Coele-Syria which they had annexed to their original territory, being
too remote from the seat of power to feel its full attraction, gradually
detached themselves and resumed their independence, their temporary
suzerains being too much exhausted by the intensity of their own
exertions to retain hold over them. Damascus, which lay almost in
the centre, at an equal distance from the Euphrates and the "river of
Egypt," could have desired no better position for grouping the rest of
Syria round her.

If any city had a chance of establishing a single kingdom, it was
Damascus, and Damascus alone. But lulled to blissful slumbers in her
shady gardens, she did not awake to political life and to the desire of
conquest until after all the rest, and at the very moment when Nineveh
was beginning to recover from her early reverses. Both Ben-hadads had
had a free hand given them during the half-century which followed, and
they had taken advantage of this respite to reduce Coele-Syria,
the Lebanon, Arvadian Phoenicia, Hamath, and the Hebrews&mdash;in fact,
two-thirds of the whole country&mdash;to subjection, and to organise that
league of the twelve kings which reckoned Ahab of Israel among its
leaders. This rudimentary kingdom had scarcely come into existence, and
its members had not yet properly combined, when Shalmaneser III. arose
and launched his bands of veterans against them; it however successfully
withstood the shock, and its stubborn resistance at the beginning of the
struggle shows us what it might have done, had its founders been allowed
time in which to weld together the various elements at their disposal.
As it was, it was doomed to succumb&mdash;not so much to the superiority of
the enemy as to the insubordination of its vassals and its own internal
discords. The league of the twelve kings did not survive Ben-hadad II.;
Hazael and his successors wore themselves out in repelling the
attacks of the Assyrians and in repressing the revolts of Israel; when
Tiglath-pileser III. arrived on the scene, both princes and people,
alike at Damascus and Samaria, were so spent that even their final
alliance could not save them from defeat. Its lack of geographical unity
and political combination had once more doomed Syria to the servitude
of alien rule; the Assyrians, with methodical procedure, first conquered
and then made vassals of all those states against which they might
have hurled their battalions in vain, had not fortune kept them divided
instead of uniting them in a compact mass under the sway of a single
ruler. From Carchemish to Arpad, from Hamath to Damascus and Samaria,
their irresistible advance had led the Assyrians on towards Egypt, the
only other power which still rivalled their prestige in the eyes of the
world; and now, at Gaza, on the frontier between Africa and Asia, as
in days gone by on the banks of the Euphrates or the Balîkh, these two
powers waited face to face, hand on hilt, each ready to stake the empire
of the Asiatic world on a single throw of the dice.
