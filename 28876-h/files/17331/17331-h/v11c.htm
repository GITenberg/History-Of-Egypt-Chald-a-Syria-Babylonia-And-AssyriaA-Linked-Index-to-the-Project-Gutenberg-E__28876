<h2>
    CHAPTER III.&mdash;EGYPT DURING THE MUHAMMEDAN PERIOD
</h2>
<p>
<i>The Rise of Muhammedanism: The Arabic Conquest of Egypt: The Ommayad
and Abbasid Dynasties.</i>
</p>
<p>
The course of history now follows the somewhat uneventful period
which introduced Arabian rule into the valley of the Nile. It is only
necessary to remind the reader of the striking incidents in the life of
Muhammed. He was born at Mecca, in Arabia, in July, 571, and spent his
earliest years in the desert. At the age of twelve he travelled with a
caravan to Syria, and probably on this occasion first came into contact
with the Jews and Christians. After a few youthful adventures, his
poetic and religious feelings were awakened by study. He gave himself
up to profound meditation upon both the Jewish and Christian ideals, and
subsequently beholding the archangel Gabriel in a vision, he proclaimed
himself as a prophet of God. After preaching his doctrine for three
years, and gaining a few converts (the first of whom was his wife,
Khadija), the people of Mecca rose against him and he was forced to
flee from the city in 614. New visions and subsequent conversions of
influential Arabs strengthened his cause, especially in Medina, whither
Muhammed was forced to flee a second time from Mecca in 622, this second
flight being known as the Hegira, from which dates the Muhammedan era.
In the next year, at Medina, he built his first mosque and married
Ayesha, and in 624 was compelled to defend his pretensions by an appeal
to arms. He was at first successful, and thereupon appointed Friday as
a day of public worship, and, being embittered against the Jews, ordered
that the attitude of prayer should no longer be towards Jerusalem, but
towards his birthplace, Mecca. In 625 the Muhammedans were defeated by
the Meccans, but one tribe after another submitted to him, and after a
series of victories Muhammed prepared, in 629, for further conquests
in Syria, but he died in 632 before they could be accomplished. His
successors were known as caliphs, but from the very first his disciples
quarrelled about the leadership, some affirming the rights of Ali,
who had married Muhammed's daughter, Fatima, and others supporting
the claims of Abu Bekr, his father-in-law. There was also a religious
quarrel concerning certain oral traditions relating to the Koran, or
the Muhammedan sacred scriptures. Those who accepted the tradition were
known as Sunnites, and those who rejected it as Shiites, the latter
being the supporters of Ali, both sects, however, being known as Moslems
or Islamites. Omar, a Sunnite, obtained the leadership in 634, and
proceeded to carry out the prophet's ambitious schemes of conquest.
He subdued successively Syria, Palestine, and Phoenicia, and in 639
directed operations against Egypt. The general in charge of this
expedition was Amr, who led four thousand men against Pelusium, which
surrendered after a siege of thirty days. This easy victory was crowned
by the capture of Alexandria. Amr entered the city on December 22, 640,
and he seems to have been surprised at his own success. He immediately
wrote to the caliph a letter in which he says:
</p>
<p>
"I have conquered the town of the West, and I cannot recount all it
contains within its walls. It contains four thousand baths and twelve
thousand venders of green vegetables, four thousand Jews who pay
tribute, and four thousand musicians and mountebanks."
</p>

</div>


<p>
Amr was anxious to conciliate and gain the affection of the new subjects
he had added to the caliph's empire, and during his short stay in
Alexandria received them with kindness and personally heard and attended
to their demands. It is commonly believed that in this period the
Alexandrian Library was dismantled; but, as we have already seen, the
books had been destroyed by the zeal of contending Christians. The story
that attributes the destruction of this world-famous institution to
the Arabian conquerors is so much a part of history, and has been so
generally accepted as correct, that the traditional version should be
given here.
</p>
<p>
Among the inhabitants of Alexandria whom Amr had so well received, says
the monkish chronicler, was one John the Grammarian, a learned
Greek, disciple of the Jacobite sect, who had been imprisoned by its
persecutors. Since his disgrace, he had given himself up entirely to
study, and was one of the most assiduous readers in the famous library.
With the change of masters he believed the rich treasure would be
speedily dispersed, and he wished to obtain a portion of it himself. So,
profiting by the special kindness Amr had shown him, and the pleasure he
appeared to take in his conversation, he ventured to ask for the gift of
several of the philosophic books whose removal would put an end to his
learned researches.
</p>
<p>
At first Amr granted this request without hesitation, but in his
gratitude John the Grammarian expatiated so unwisely on the extreme
rarity of the manuscripts and their inestimable value, that Amr, on
reflection, feared he had overstepped his power in granting the learned
man's request. "I will refer the matter to the caliph," he said,
and thereupon wrote immediately to Omar and asked the caliph for
his commands concerning the disposition of the whole of the precious
contents of the library.
</p>
<p>
The caliph's answer came quickly. "If," he wrote, "the books contain
only what is in the book of God (the Koran), it is enough for us, and
these books are useless. If they contain anything contrary to the holy
book, they are pernicious. In any case, burn them."
</p>


<p>
Amr wished to organise his new government, and, having left a sufficient
garrison in Alexandria, he gave orders to the rest of his army to leave
the camp in the town and to occupy the interior of Egypt. "Where shall
we pitch our new camp?" the soldiers asked each other, and the answer
came from all parts, "Round the general's tent." The army, in fact,
did camp on the banks of the Nile, in the vicinity of the modern Cairo,
where Amr had ordered his tent to be left; and round this tent, which
had become the centre of reunion, the soldiers built temporary huts
which were soon changed into solid, permanent habitations. Spacious
houses were built for the leaders, and palaces for the generals, and
this collection of buildings soon became an important military town,
with strongly marked Muhammedan characteristics. It was called Fostât
(tent) in memory of the event, otherwise unimportant, which was the
origin of its creation. Amr determined to make his new town the capital
of Egypt; whilst still preserving the name of Fostât, he added that of
Misr,&mdash;a title always borne by the capital of Egypt, and which Memphis
had hitherto preserved in spite of the rivalry of Alexandria.
</p>
<p>
Fostât was then surrounded by fortifications, and Amr took up his
residence there, forming various establishments and giving himself up
entirely to the organisation of the vast province whose government the
caliph had entrusted to him. The personal tax, which was the only one,
had been determined in a fixed manner by the treaty of submission he
had concluded with the Kopts; and an unimportant ground rent on landed
property was added in favour of the holy towns of Mecca and Medina, as
well as to defray some expenses of local administration.
</p>
<a name="image-0006"><!--IMG--></a>

<p>
Egypt was entirely divided into provincial districts, all of which
had their own governor and administrators taken from among the Kopts
themselves. The lands which had belonged to the imperial government of
Constantinople, and those of the Greeks who had abandoned Egypt or been
killed in the war against the Mussulmans, were either declared to be the
property of the new government or given out again as fiefs or rewards
to the chief officers of the army. All these lands were leased to the
Koptic farmers, and the respective rights of the new proprietors
or tenant farmers and of the peasant proprietors were determined by
decisive and invariable rules. Thus the agricultural population enjoyed
under the Mussulmans a security and ease which replaced the tyrannical
annoyances and arbitrary exactions of the Christian agents of the
treasury of Constantinople; for, in fact, little by little, there had
disappeared under these Greek agents the sound principles of the old
administration that had been established by the wise kings of ancient
Egypt, and which the Ptolemies had scrupulously preserved, as did also
the first governors under the Cæsars.
</p>
<p>
After all these improvements in the internal administration, the
governor turned his attention to the question of justice, which until
that moment had been subject to the decision of financial agents, or
of the soldiers of the Greek government. Amr now created permanent and
regular tribunals composed of honourable, independent, and enlightened
men, who enjoyed public respect and esteem. To Amr dates back the first
of those <i>divans</i>, chosen from the élite of the population, as sureties
of the fairness of the <i>cadis</i>, which received appeals from first
judgments to confirm them, or, in the case of wrongful decisions, to
alter them. The decrees of the Arab judges had force only for those
Mussulmans who formed a part of the occupying army. Whenever a Koptic
inhabitant was a party in an action, the Koptic authorities had the
right to intervene, and the parties were judged by their equals in race
and religion.
</p>
<p>
One striking act of justice succeeded in winning for Amr the hearts of
all. Despite the terror inspired by the religious persecutions which
Heraclius had carried on with so much energy, one man, the Koptic
patriarch Benjamin, had bravely kept his faith intact. He belonged
to the Jacobite sect and abandoned none of its dogmas, and in their
intolerance the all-powerful Melchites did not hesitate to choose him as
their chief victim. Benjamin was dispossessed of his patriarchal throne,
his liberty and life were threatened, and he only succeeded in saving
both by taking flight. He lived thus forgotten in the various refuges
that the desert monasteries afforded him, while Heraclius replaced him
by an ardent supporter of the opinions favoured at court. The whole of
Egypt was then divided into two churches separated from each other by an
implacable hatred. At the head of the Melchites was the new patriarch,
who was followed by a few priests and a small number of partisans who
were more attached to him by fear than by faith. The Jacobites, on the
other hand, comprised the immense majority of the population, who looked
upon the patriarch as an intruder chosen by the emperor. The church
still acknowledged as its real head Benjamin, the patriarch who had been
for thirteen years a wanderer, and whose return was ardently desired.
This wish found public expression as soon as the downfall of the
imperial power in Egypt permitted its free manifestation. Amr listened
to the supplications that were addressed to him, and, turning out the
usurper in his turn, recalled Benjamin from his long exile and replaced
him on the patriarchal throne.
</p>
<p>
But even here Amr's protection of the Koptic religion did not end.
He opened the door of his Mussulman town, and allowed them to live
in Fostât and to build churches there in the midst of the Mussulman
soldiers, even when Islamism was still without a temple in the city, or
a consecrated place worthy of the religion of the conquerors.
</p>
<p>
Amr at length resolved to build in his new capital a magnificent mosque
in imitation of the one at Mecca. Designs were speedily drawn up, the
location of the new temple being, according to Arab authors, that of an
ancient pyre consecrated by the Persians, and which had been in ruins
since the time of the Ptolemies.
</p>

alt="333.jpg a Modern Kopt

</center>

<p>
The monuments of Memphis had often been pillaged by Greek and Roman
emperors, and now they were once again despoiled to furnish the mosque
of Amr with the beautiful colonnades of marble and porphyry which adorn
the walls, and on which, the Arab historians assure us, the whole Koran
was written in letters of gold.
</p>
<p>
Omar died in 644, and under his successor, Othman, the Arabian conquests
were extended in Northern Africa. Othman dying in 656, the claims of Ali
were warmly supported, but not universally recognised, many looking to
Muawia as an acceptable candidate for the caliphate. This was especially
the view of the Syrian Muham-medans, and in 661 Muawia I. was elected
caliph. He promptly transferred the capital from Medina to Damascus, and
became in fact the founder of a dynasty known as the Ommayads, the new
caliph being a descendant of the famous Arabian chieftain Ommayad. Egypt
acknowledged the new authority and remained quiet and submissive. It
furnished Abd el-Malik, who became caliph in 685, not only with rich
subsidies and abundant provisions, but also with part of his troops.
</p>
<p>
The attachment of the Egyptians to their new masters was chiefly owing
to the gentleness and wisdom of Abd el-Aziz ibn Merwan, who administered
the country after Amr was put to death in 689. He visited all the
provinces of Egypt, and, arriving at Alexandria, he ordered the
building of a bridge over the canal, recognising the importance of this
communication between the town and country.
</p>
<p>
Benefiting by the religious liberty that Mussulman sovereignship had
secured them, the Kopts no longer attended to the quarrels of their
masters. They only occupied themselves in maintaining the quiet
peaceful-ness they had obtained by regular payment of their taxes, and
by supplying men and commodities when occasion demanded it. During the
reign of Abd el-Malik in Egypt the only remarkable event there was the
election, in 688, of the Jacobite Isaac as patriarch of Alexandria. The
Koptic clergy give him no other claim to historical remembrance than
the formulating of a decree ordaining "that the patriarch can only be
inaugurated on a Sunday."
</p>

</center>

<p>
Isaac was succeeded by Simon the Syrian, whom the Koptic church looks
upon as a saint, and for whom is claimed the power of reviving the dead.
He nevertheless died from the effects of poison given him at the altar
by some jealous rival. Arab historians relate how deputies came to Simon
from India to ask for a bishop and some priests. The patriarch refused
to comply with this request, but Abd el-Aziz, thinking that this
relation with India might prove politically useful, gave the order to
other and more docile priests.
</p>
<p>
The patriarchal seat was empty for three years after the death of Simon.
The Kopts next appointed a patriarch named Alexander, who held the
office for a little over twenty years. The Koptic writers who recount
the history of this patriarch mention their discontent with the governor
Abd el-Aziz. The monks and other members of the clergy had grown very
numerous in Egypt and claimed to be exempt from taxation. Abd el-Aziz,
whose yearly tax was fixed, thought it unjust that the poorest classes
of the people should be made to pay while the priests, the bishop,
and the patriarch, all possessing abundance, should be privileged by
exemption. He therefore had a census made of all the monks and put
on them a tax of one dinar (about $2.53), while he exacted from the
patriarch an annual payment of three thousand dinars, or about $7,600.
This act of justice was the cause of many complaints among the clergy,
but they were soon suppressed and were without result.

<p>
After more than twenty years of a prosperous government of Egypt, Abd
el-Aziz ibn Merwan died at Fostât in the year 708 (a.h. 86) at the very
time when, with many fresh plans for the future, he had completed the
building of a large and magnificent palace called ed-Dar el-mudahaba
(the golden house), and a quarter of the town called Suk el-hammam (the
pigeon market). The Caliph Abd el-Malik felt deeply the loss of this
brother, whose qualities he highly appreciated and whom he had appointed
as his successor.
</p>
<p>
He now named as his heir to the caliphate Walid, his eldest son, and
replaced Abd el-Aziz in the government of Egypt with his second son,
Abd Allah ibn Abd el-Malik. The Kopts hoped to obtain from the new
governor the repeal of the act that exacted yearly tribute from the
clergy, but Abd Allah did not think it fair to grant this unjust
discrimination against the poorer classes of the Egyptians. Those monks
who have written the history of the patriarchs have therefore painted
Abd Allah in even blacker colours than they did his predecessor. For
the rest, Abd Allah only held the reins of government in Egypt until the
death of his father, which occurred a few months later.
</p>
<a name="image-0010"><!--IMG--></a>

</div>


<p>
Suleiman succeeded his brother Walid I. The new caliph vigorously put
into execution all the plans his brother had formed for the propagation
of the religion of the Prophet. In the first year of his reign he
conquered Tabaristan and Georgia, and sent his brother Maslama to lay
fresh siege to Constantinople. On his accession to the throne Suleiman
placed the government of Egypt in the hands of Assama ibn Yazid, with
the title of agent-general of finances.
</p>
<p>
The Koptic clerical historians, according to their usual habit, portray
this governor as still worse than his predecessors, but in this case
the Mussulman authorities are in agreement in accusing him of the most
iniquitous extortions and most barbarous massacres. The gravest reproach
they bring against him is that, calling all the monks together, he told
them that not only did he intend to maintain the old regulations of Abd
el-Aziz, by which they had to pay an annual tax of one dinar ($2.53),
but also that they would be obliged to receive yearly from his agents an
iron ring bearing their name and the date of the financial transaction,
for which ring they were to make personal contribution. He forced
the wearing of this ring continually, and the hand found without this
strange form of receipt was to be cut off. Several monks who endeavoured
to evade this strict order were pitilessly mutilated, while a number of
them, rebelling against the payment of the tax, retired into convents,
thinking they could safely defraud the treasury. Assama, however, sent
his soldiers to search these retreats, and all the monks found without
rings were beheaded or put to death by the bastinado.
</p>
<a name="image-0011"><!--IMG--></a>

<div class="figleft" style="width:45%;">
        <img width="100%"
        src="images/338.jpg"
alt="338.jpg Coin of Malik 
">

</div>


<p>
Careful about all that related to the Egyptian revenues, Assama
commanded the keeping up of the various Nilometers, which still served
to regulate the assessment of the ground tax. In the year 718 he learned
that the Nilometer established at Helwan, a little below Fostât, had
fallen in, and hastened to report the fact to the caliph. By the orders
of this prince the ruined Nilometer was abandoned, and a new one built
at the meridional point of the island now called Rhodha, just between
Fostât and Gizeh.
</p>


<p>
But of all the financial transactions of Assama, the one that vexed most
the inhabitants of Egypt, and which brought down on him the most violent
and implacable hatred, was the ordinance by which all ascending or
descending the Nile were obliged to provide themselves with a passport
bearing a tax. This exorbitant claim was carried out with an abusive
and arbitrary sternness. A poor widow, the Oriental writers say, was
travelling up the Nile with her son, having with her a correct passport,
the payment of which had taken nearly all she possessed. The young man,
while stretched along the boat to drink of the river's water, was seized
by a crocodile and swallowed, together with the passport he carried
in his breast. The treasury officers insisted that the wretched widow
should take a fresh one; and to obtain payment for it she sold all she
had, even to the very clothes she wore. Such intolerable exactions
and excesses ended by thoroughly rousing the indignant Egyptians. The
malcontents assembled, and a general revolt would have been the result
but for the news of the death of the Caliph Suleiman (717), which gave
birth to the hope that justice might be obtained from his successor.

The next caliph was Omar II., a grandson of Merwan I., who had been
nominated as his successor by Suleiman. In his reign the Muhammedans
were repulsed from Constantinople, and the political movement began
which finally established the Abbasid dynasty at Baghdad. Omar dying
in the year 720, Yazid II., a son of Abd el-Malik, succeeded to the
caliphate, and reigned for four years, history being for the most part
silent as to the general condition of Egypt under these two caliphs.
It is recorded that in the year 720, one of Yazid's brothers, by name
Muhammed ibn Abd el-Malik, ruled over Egypt. The Kopts complained of his
rule, and declared that during the whole reign of Yazid ibn Abd el-Malik
the Christians were persecuted, crosses overthrown, and churches
destroyed.

<p>
Yazid was succeeded, in 724 A.D., by his brother Hisham, surnamed
Abu'l-Walid, the fourth son of Abd el-Malik to occupy the throne of
Islam, who, having been appointed by his brother as his successor, took
possession of the throne on the very day of his death. Muhammed was
replaced in Egypt by his cousin, Hassan ibn Yusuf, who only held office
for three years, resigning voluntarily in the year 730 a.d., or 108 of
the Hegira. The Caliph Hisham replaced him by Hafs ibn Walid, who was
deposed a year later, and in the year 109 of the Hegira the caliph
appointed in his place Abd el-Malik ibn Rifa, who had already governed
Egypt during the caliphate of Walid I. Hisham made many changes in
the governorship of Egypt, and amid a succession of rulers appointed
Handhala to the post. He had already been governor of Egypt under Yazid
II. He administered the province for another six years, and, according
to the Christian historians of the East, pursued the same course of
intolerance and tyranny that he had adopted when he governed Egypt for
the first time under Yazid.
</p>
<p>
The Caliph Hisham enjoined Handhala to be gentle with his subjects and
to treat the Christians with kindness, but far from conforming with
these wise and kindly intentions, he overwhelmed them with vexations and
tyrannous acts. He doubled the taxes by a general census, subjecting not
only men but also their animals to an impost. The receipts for the
new duty had to be stamped with the impression of a lion, and every
Christian found without one of these documents was deprived of one of
his hands.
</p>
<p>
In the year 746 (a.h. 124), on being informed of these abuses, the
caliph deprived him of the government of Egypt, and, giving him the
administration of Mauritania, appointed as his successor Hafs ibn Walid,
who, according to some accounts, had previously governed Egypt for
sixteen years, and who had left pleasanter recollections behind him.
Hafs, however, now only held office for a year.
</p>
<p>
Nothing of political importance happened in Egypt under the long reign
of Hisham, the only events noticed by the Christian historians being
those which relate solely to their ecclesiastical history. The 108th
year of the Hegira saw the death of Alexander, the forty-third Koptic
Patriarch of Alexandria. Since the conquest of Egypt by Omar, for a
period of about twenty-four years, the patriarchate had been in the
hands of the Jacobites; all the bishops in Egypt belonged to that sect,
and they had established Jacobite bishops even in Nubia, which they had
converted to their religion. The orthodox Christians elected Kosmas as
their patriarch. At that time the heretics had taken possession of all
the churches in Egypt, and the patriarch only retained that of Mar-Saba,
or the Holy Sabbath. Kosmas, by his solicitations, obtained from
Hisham an order to his financial administrator in Egypt, Abd Allah ibn
es-Sakari, to see that all the churches were returned to the sect to
which they belonged.
</p>
<p>
After occupying the patriarchal throne for only fifteen months,
Kosmas died. In the 109th year of the Hegira (a. d. 727-28) Kosmas was
succeeded by the patriarch Theodore. He occupied the seat for eleven
years. His patriarchate was a period of peace and quiet for the church
of Alexandria, and caused a temporary cessation of the quarrels between
the Melchites and the Jacobites. A vacancy of six years followed his
death until, in the year 127 of the Hegira (749 a. d.), Ibn Khalil was
promoted to the office of patriarch, and held his seat for twenty-three
years.
</p>
<p>
Walid II. succeeded to the caliphate in the year 749. One of his first
acts was to take the government of Egypt from Hafs, in spite of the
kindness of his rule, the wisdom and moderation of which had gained
for him the affection of all the provinces which he governed. He was
replaced by Isa ibn Abi Atta, who soon created a universal discontent,
as his administrative measures were oppressive.
</p>
<p>
In the year 750 the Ommayads were supplanted by the Abbasids, who
transferred the capital from Damascus to Baghdad. The first Abbasid
caliph was Abu'l-Abbas, who claimed descent from Abbas, the uncle of
Muhammed. The caliph Merwan II., the last of the Ommayads, in his flight
from his enemies came to Egypt and sent troops from Fostât to hold
Alexandria. He was now pursued to his death by the Abbasid general Salih
ibn Ali, who took possession of Postât for the new dynasty in 750. The
change from the Ommayad to the Abbasid caliphs was effected with little
difficulty, and Egypt continued to be a province of the caliphate and
was ruled by governors who were mostly Arabs or members of the Abbasid
family.
</p>
<p>
Abu'l-Abbas, after being inaugurated, began his rule by recalling all
the provincial governors, whom he replaced by his kinsmen and partisans.
He entrusted the government of Egypt to his paternal uncle, Salih ibn
Ali, who had obtained the province for him. Salih, however, did not rule
in person, but was represented by Abu Aun Abd el-Malik ibn Yazid, whom
he appointed vice-governor. The duties of patriarch of Alexandria were
then performed by Michel, commonly called Khail by the Kopts. This
patriarch was of the Jacobite sect and the forty-fifth successor of St.
Mark: he held the office about three years. He in turn was succeeded by
the patriarch Myna, a native of Semennud (the ancient Sebennytus).
</p>
<p>
In the year 754 Abu'l-Abbas died at the age of thirty-two, after
reigning four years, eight months, and twenty-six days, the Arabian
historians being always very precise in recording the duration of the
reign of the caliphs. He was the first of the caliphs to appoint a
vizier, the Ommayad caliphs employing only secretaries during their
administration. The successor of Abu'l-Abbas was his brother Abu
Jafar, surnamed El-Man-sur. Three years after his accession he took the
government of Egypt from his uncle, and in less than seven years Egypt
passed successively through the hands of six different governors. These
changes were instigated by the mistrustful disposition of the caliph,
who saw in every man a traitor and conspirator, dismissing on the
slightest provocation his most devoted adherents, some of whom were even
put to death by his orders. His last choice, Yazid ibn Hatim, governed
Egypt for eight years, and the caliph bestowed the title of Prince
of Egypt (Emir Misri) upon him, which title was also borne by his
successors.
</p>
<p>
These continual changes in the government of Egypt had not furthered
the prosperity and well-being of the inhabitants. Each ruler, certain
of speedy dismissal, busied himself with his personal affairs to the
detriment of the country, anxious only to amass by every possible
means sufficient money to compensate him for his inevitable deposition.
Moreover, each governor increased the taxation levied by his
predecessor. Such was the greed and rapacity of these governors that
every industry was continually subjected to increased taxation; the
working bricklayer, the vender of vegetables, the camel-driver, the
gravedigger, all callings, even that of mendicant, were taxed, and the
lower classes were reduced to eating dog's flesh and human remains. At
the moment when Egypt, unable to support such oppression longer, was on
the verge of insurrection, the welcome tidings of the death of El-Mansur
arrived.
</p>
<p>
Muhammed el-Mahdi, son of El-Mansur, succeeded his father and was the
third caliph of the house of Abbas. He was at Baghdad when his father
expired near Mecca, but, despite his absence, was immediately proclaimed
caliph. El-Mahdi betrayed in his deeds that same fickleness which
had signalised the caliphate of his father, El-Mansur. He appointed
a different governor of Egypt nearly every year. These many changes
resulted probably from the political views held by the caliph, or
perhaps he already perceived the tendency shown by each of his provinces
to separate itself from the centre of Islamism. Perhaps also he already
foresaw those divisions which destroyed the empire about half a century
later. Thus his prudence sought, in allowing but a short period of power
to each governor, to prevent their strengthening themselves sufficiently
in their provinces to become independent.
</p>
<a name="image-0014"><!--IMG--></a>

<div class="figleft" style="width:34%;">

">

</div>

<p>
Egypt remained calm and subdued under these constant changes of
government. Syria and the neighbouring provinces followed suit, and the
Caliph el-Mahdi profited by this peaceful state of things to attack the
Emperor of the Greeks. His second son, Harun, undertook the continuation
of this war, and the young prince displayed such talent and bravery
that he gained brilliant victories, and returned to Baghdad after having
captured several cities from the Greeks, overthrown their generals,
and forced Constantinople to pay an annual tribute of seventy thousand
dinars (about $180,000). The Caliph el-Mahdi rewarded Harun by solemnly
naming him the future successor of his eldest son, Musa el-Hadi, whom he
had just definitely declared his heir to the throne. Shortly after this
decision, el-Mahdi died, in the year 785, having reigned ten years and
two months.
</p>
<p>
Musa el-Hadi, his eldest son, succeeded him, being the fourth caliph
of the race of Abbasids. On ascending the throne, he withdrew the
government of Egypt from Fadl ibn Salih, appointing in his place Ali ibn
Suleiman, also a descendant of Abbas. El-Hadi plotted against the claims
of Harun to the succession, but he died before his plans had matured,
and Harun became caliph in the year 786.
</p>
<p>
The reign of Harun er-Rashid was the most brilliant epoch of the empire
of Islamism, and his glory penetrated from the far East to the western
countries of Europe, where his name is still celebrated.
</p>


<p>
Harun seems to have been as reluctant as his father and grandfather were
before him to leave a province too long in the hands of a governor, and
he even surpassed them in his precautionary measures. In the year 171
of the Hegira, he recalled Ali ibn Suleiman, and gave the government of
Egypt to Musa ibn Isa, a descendant of the Caliph Ali.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter the governors were changed on an average of once a year,
and their financial duties were separately administered. Musa ibn Isa,
however, held the appointment of Governor of Egypt on three separate
occasions, and of his third period Said ibn Batrik tells the following
anecdote:
</p>
<p>
"While Obaid Allah ibn el-Mahdi was ruling in Egypt," he relates, "he
sent a beautiful young Koptic slave to his brother, the caliph, as a
gift. The Egyptian odalisk so charmed the caliph that he fell violently
in love with her. Suddenly, however, the favourite was laid prostrate
by a malady which the court physicians could neither cure nor even
diagnose. The girl insisted that, being Egyptian, only an Egyptian
physician could cure her. The caliph instantly ordered his brother to
send post haste the most skilful doctor in Egypt. This proved to be the
Melchite patriarch, for in those days Koptic priests practised medicine
and cultivated other sciences. The patriarch set out for Baghdad,
restored the favourite to health, and in reward received from the
caliph an imperial diploma, which restored to the orthodox Christians
or Melchites all those privileges of which they had been deprived by the
Jacobite heretics since their union with the conqueror Amr ibn el-Asi."
</p>
<p>
If this story be true, one cannot but perceive the plot skilfully laid
and carried out by the powerful clergy, to whom any means, even the
sending of a concubine to the caliph, seemed legitimate to procure the
restoration of their supremacy and the humiliation of their adversaries.
</p>
<a name="image-0015"><!--IMG--></a>

</div>


<p>
The year 204 of the Hegira was memorable for the death of the Iman
Muhammed ibn Idris, surnamed esh-Shafi. This celebrated doctor was the
founder of one of the four orthodox sects which recognised the Moslem
religion, and whose followers take the name "Shafites" from their chief.
The Iman esh-Shafi died at Fostât when but forty-three years old. His
dogmas are more especially followed in Egypt, where his sect is still
represented and presided over by one of the four Imans at the head of
the famous Mosque Jam el-Azar, or mosque of flowers.
</p>
<p>
The distance of Egypt from Baghdad, the caliph's capital, was the cause
of the neglect of many of his commands, and upon more than one occasion
was his authority slighted. Thus it happened that for more than five
years the government of Egypt was in the hands of Abd Allah ibn es-Sari,
whom the soldiers elected, but whose appointment was never confirmed by
the caliph. Abd Allah ibn Tahir, the son of the successful general, had,
in the year a.h. 210, settled at Belbeys in Egypt. With a large number
of partisans, he assumed almost regal privileges. In 211 a.h. he
proceeded to Fostât and there dismissed Abd Allah ibn es-Sari and
replaced him by Ayad ibn Ibrahim, whom he also dismissed the following
year, giving the governorship to Isa ibn Yazid, surnamed el-Jalud. In
the year 213, the Caliph el-Mamun ordered Abd Allah ibn Tahir to retire,
and confided the government of Egypt and also that of Syria to his own
brother el-Mutasim, third son of the Caliph Ilarun er-Rashid.
</p>
<p>
In the year 218 of the Hegira (a. d. 833), Muhammed el-Mutasim succeeded
his brother el-Mamun. He was the first caliph who brought the name of
God into his surname. On ascending the throne, he assumed the title
el-Mutasim b'lllah, that is "strengthened by God," and his example was
followed by all his successors.
</p>
<p>
From the commencement of this reign, el-Mutasim b'lllah was forced to
defend himself against insurgents and aspirants to the caliphate. In
the year 219 of the Hegira, Kindi, the Governor of Egypt, died, and the
caliph named his son, Mudhaffar ibn Kindi, as his successor. Mudhaffar
ibn Kindi, dying the following year, was succeeded by Musa, son of
Abu'l-Abbas, surnamed esh-Shirbani by some writers, esh-Shami (the
Syrian) by others. In the year 224 Musa was recalled and his place
taken by Malik, surnamed by some el-Hindi (the Indian), by others ibn
el-Kindi. A year later the caliph dismissed Malik, and sent Ashas to
Egypt in his place. This was the last governor appointed by el-Mutasim
b'lllah, for the caliph died of fever in the year 227 of the Hegira.
</p>
<p>
Oriental historians have noticed that the numeral eight affected this
caliph in a singular manner. Between himself and Abbas, the head of his
house, there were eight generations; he was born in the month of Shaban,
the eighth month of the Mussulman year; he was the eighth Abbasidian
caliph, and ascended the throne in the year 218, aged thirty-eight years
and eight months; he reigned eight years, eight months, and eight days,
and died in the forty-eighth year of his age, leaving eight sons and
eight daughters. He fought in eight battles, and on his death eight
million dinars and eighty thousand dirhems were discovered in his
private treasury. It is this singular coincidence which gave him the
name Mutamma.
</p>
<a name="image-0016"><!--IMG--></a>

<div class="figleft" style="width:46%;">
        <img width="100%"
        src="images/351.jpg"
alt="351.jpg Tomb of a Sheikh 
">

</div>


<p>
But a sadder fatality exercised its influence over the Caliph Mutamma,
for from him dates the beginning of the decadence of his dynasty, and
to him its first cause may be ascribed. The fact is, Mutasim was
uneducated, without ability, and lacking in moral principles; he was
unable even to write. Endowed with remarkable strength and muscles
of iron, he was able, so Arab historians relate, to lift and carry
exceptionally heavy weights; to this strength was added indomitable
courage and love of warfare, fine weapons, horses, and warriors. This
taste led him, even before the death of his father, to organise a picked
corps, for which he selected the finest, handsomest, and strongest of
the young Turkish slaves taken in war, or sent as tribute to the caliph.
</p>
<p>
The vast nation, sometimes called Turks, sometimes Tatars, was
distributed, according to all Oriental geographers, over all the
countries of Northern Asia, from the river Jihun or Oxus to Kathay or
China. That the Turks and the Arabs, both bent upon a persistent
policy of conquest, should come into more or less hostile contact
was inevitable. The struggle was a long one, and during the numerous
engagements many prisoners were taken on both sides. Those Turks who
fell into the hands of the Arabs were sent to the different provinces
of their domain, where they became slaves of the chief emirs and of the
caliphs themselves, where, finding favour in the eyes of the caliphs,
they were soon transferred to their personal retinue. The distrust which
the caliphs felt for the emirs of their court, whose claims they were
only able to appease by making vassals of them, caused them to commit
the grave error of confiding in these alien slaves, who, barbaric
and illiterate as they were, now living in the midst of princes, soon
acquired a knowledge of Muhammedanism, the sciences, and, above all, the
politics of the country.
</p>
<p>
It was not long before they were able to fill the most responsible
positions, and, given their freedom by the caliphs, were employed by the
government according to their abilities. Not only were they given the
chief positions at court, but the government of the principal provinces
was entrusted to them. They repaid these favours later by the blackest
ingratitude, especially when the formation of a Turkish guard brought
a number of their own countrymen under their influence. Ever anxious to
augment his own body-guard, and finding the number of Turks he annually
received as tribute insufficient, el-Mutasim purchased a great many
for the purpose of training them for that particular service. But these
youths speedily abused the confidence shown them by the caliph, who,
perceiving that their insolence was daily growing more insupportable to
the inhabitants of Baghdad, resolved to leave the capital, rebuild the
ancient city of Samarrah and again make it the seat of the empire.
</p>
<p>
At this time the captain of the caliph's guard was one Tulun, a
freedman, whom fate would seem to have reduced to servitude for the
purpose of showing that a slave might found a dynasty destined to rule
over Egypt and Syria. Tulun belonged to the Toghus-ghur, one of the
twenty-four tribes composing the population of Turkestan. His family
dwelt near Lake Lop, in Little Bukhara. He was taken prisoner in battle
by Nuh ibn Assad es-Samami, then in command at Bukhara. This prince,
who was subject to the Caliph Mamun, paid an annual tribute of slaves,
Turkish horses, and other valuables. In the year 815 a. d., Tulun was
among the slaves sent as tribute to the caliph, who, attracted by his
bearing, enrolled him in his own body-guard.
</p>
<p>
Before long he had so gained the caliph's confidence that Mamun gave him
his freedom and the command of the guard, at the same time appointing
him Emir es-sitri, prince of the veil or curtain. This post, which was a
mark of the greatest esteem, comprised the charge of the personal safety
of the sovereign, by continually keeping watch without the curtain or
rich drapery which hung before the private apartments, and admitting no
one without a special order. Tulun spent twenty years at the court of
el-Mamun and of his successor, Mutasim, and became the father of several
children, one of which, Ahmed ibn Tulun,* known later as Abu l'Abbas,
was the founder of the Tulunide dynasty in Egypt and Syria.
</p>
<pre>
     * Ahmed ibn Tulun was, according to some historians, born at
     Baghdad in the year 220 of the Hegira, in the third year of
     the reign of el-Mutasim b' Illah. Others claim Samarrah as
     his birthplace. His mother, a young Turkish slave, was named
     Kassimeh, or some say, Hachimeh. Some historians have denied
     that Ahmed was the son of Tulun, one of them, Suyuti, in a
     manuscript belonging to Marcel, quotes Abu Asakar in
     confirmation of this assertion, who pretends he was told by
     an old Egyptian that Ahmed was the son of a Turk named Mahdi
     and of Kassimeh, the slave of Tulun. Suyuti adds that Tulun
     adopted the child on account of his good qualities, but this
     statement is unsupported and seems contradicted by
     subsequent events.
</pre>
<p>
Before Ahmed ibn Tulun had reached an age to take part in political
affairs, two caliphs succeeded Mutasim b'lllah. The first was his son
Harun abu Jafar, who, upon his accession, assumed the surname el-Wathik
b'lllah (trusting in God). Wathik carried on the traditional policy of
continually changing the governors of the provinces, and, dying in the
year 847, was succeeded by his half-brother Mutawakkil. In the following
year the new caliph confided the government of Egypt to Anbasa, but
dismissed him a few months later in favour of his own son el-Muntasir
ibn el-Mutawakkil, whom two years afterwards the caliph named as his
successor to the throne. El-Muntasir was to be immediately succeeded by
his two younger brothers, el-Mutazz b'lllah and el-Mujib b'lllah.
</p>
<p>
Mutawakkil then proceeded to divide his kingdom, giving Africa and
all his Eastern possessions, from the frontier of Egypt to the eastern
boundary of his states, to his eldest son. His second son, el-Mutazz,
received Khorassan, Tabaristan, Persia, Armenia, and Aderbaijan as his
portion, and to el-Mujib, his third son, he gave Damascus, Hemessa, the
basin of the Jordan, and Palestine.
</p>
<p>
These measures, by which the caliph hoped to satisfy the ambitions
of his sons, did not have the desired effect. Despite the immense
concessions he had received, el-Muntasir, anxious to commence his rule
over the whole of the Islam empire, secretly conspired against his
father and meditated taking his life. Finding that in Egypt he was too
far from the scene of his intrigues, he deputed the government of that
country to Yazid ibn Abd Allah, and returned to his father's court to
encourage the malcontents and weave fresh plots. His evil schemes soon
began to bear fruit, for, in the year 244 of the Hegira, his agents
stirred up the Turkish soldiery at Damascus to insurrection on the
ground of deferred payment. Whereupon the caliph paid them the arrears,
and left Damascus to retire to Samarrah.
</p>

<img src="images/356.jpg" height="704" width="607"
alt="356.jpg the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, Cairo. 
">
</center>

<p>
At length, in the year 861 (a.h. 247), Mutawakkil discovered the
scarcely concealed treachery of his son, and reproved him publicly.
Some days later the caliph was murdered at night by the captain of his
Turkish Guard, and Muntasir, who is commonly supposed to have
instigated the crime, was immediately proclaimed as his successor in the
government.
</p>
<p>
The most important event in Egypt during the reign of Mutawakkil was the
falling in of the Nilometer at Fostât. This disaster, was the result of
an earthquake of considerable violence, which was felt throughout
Syria. The caliph ordered the reconstruction of the Nilometer, which was
accomplished the same year, and the Nilometer of the Island of Rhodha
was then called Magaz el-jedid, or the New Nilometer.
</p>
<p>
After reigning scarcely a year, Muntasir himself succumbed, most
probably to poison, and his cousin Ahmed was elected to the caliphate by
the Turkish soldiery, with the title of Mustain. During his brief reign
the Moslems were defeated by the Byzantines at Awasia, and in 866 the
Turkish soldiers revolted against the caliph and elected his brother
Mutazz in his place. Mustain was, however, allowed to retire to Ma'szit.
He was permitted to take an attendant with him, and his choice fell upon
Ahmed, the son of Tulun, already mentioned. Ahmed served the dethroned
prince truly, and had no part in the subsequent murder of this unhappy
man.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime the mother of Ahmed had married the influential General
Baik-Bey, and when the latter was given the rulership of Egypt in the
year 868 a. d. (254 a.h.), he sent his stepson as proxy, according to
the custom of the time. On the 23d Ramadhan 254 (15th September, 868),
Ahmed ibn Tulun arrived at Fostât. He encountered great difficulties,
and discovered that at Alexandria and also in other districts there were
independent emirs, who were not directly under the ruler. Soon after his
arrival an insurrection broke out in Upper Egypt. Ahmed showed himself
born to the place; he crushed the uprising and also suppressed a second
revolt that was threatening. By degrees he cleverly undermined the power
of his colleagues, and made his own position in Fostât secure.

">

</div>

<p>
When Muaffik was nominated commander-in-chief of the West by his brother
Mustamid (elected caliph in 870), Ahmed managed to secure the good-will
of the vizier of the caliph and thus to obtain the command in Egypt.
He kept the regent in Baghdad in a state of complacency, occasionally
sending him tribute; but, as wars with the Sinds began to trouble the
caliphate, he did not think it worth while to trouble himself further
about Baghdad, and decided to keep his money for himself. Muaffik
was not the man to stand this, and prepared to attack Ahmed, but the
disastrous results of the last war had not yet passed away. When the
army intended for Egypt was camping in Mesopotamia, there was not enough
money to pay the troops, and the undertaking had to be deferred.
</p>
<p>
Ahmed had a free hand over the enormous produce of Egypt. The compulsory
labour of the industrious Kopt brought in a yearly income of four
million gold dinars ($10,120,000), and yet these people felt themselves
better off than formerly on account of the greater order and peace that
existed under his energetic government. It cannot be denied that Ahmed
in the course of years became much more extravagant and luxurious,
but he used his large means in some measure for the betterment of the
country. He gave large sums not only for the erection of palaces and
barracks, but also for hospitals and educational advancement. To this
day is to be seen the mosque of Ibn Tulun, built by him in the newer
part of Fostât,&mdash;a district which was later annexed to the town of
Cairo.
</p>


<p>
The numerous wars in which Muaffik was involved gave Ahmed the
opportunity of extending his power beyond the boundaries of Egypt. The
ruler of the caliphate of Damascus died in the year 897, and soon after
Ahmed marched into Syria, and, with the exception of Antioch, which
had to be taken by force, the whole country fell into the hands of
the mighty emir. The commanders of isolated districts did not feel
themselves encouraged to offer any resistance, for they had no feeling
of faithfulness for the government, nor had they any hope of assistance
from Baghdad.
</p>
<p>
The triumphant march of Tulun was hindered in the year 879 by bad news
from Fostât. One of his sons, El-Abbas, had quarrelled with his father,
and had marched to Barca, with troops which he led afterwards to
disaster, and had taken with him money to the amount of 1,000,000 dinars
($2,530,000). He thought himself safe from his enraged father there,
but the latter quickly returned to Fostât, and the news of the ample
preparations which he was hastening for the subjection of his rebel
son caused El-Abbas to place himself still farther out of his reach. He
suddenly attacked the state of Ibrahim II. (the Aghlabite), and caused
serious trouble with his soldiery in the eastern districts of Tripolis.
The neighbouring Berbers gave Ibrahim their assistance, and Abbas was
defeated and retreated to Barca in 880. He remained there some time
until an army sent by Ahmed annihilated his troops and he himself was
taken prisoner.
</p>
<p>
The rebellion of his son was the turning-point in Ahmed's career: Lulu,
his general in Mesopotamia, deserted him for Muaffik, and an endeavour
to conquer Mecca was frustrated by the unexpected resistance of numbers
of newly arrived pilgrims. Ahmed now caused the report to be spread that
Muaffik was a conspirator against the representatives of the Prophet,
thus depriving him of his dignity.

<p>
The emir had also besieged in vain at Tarsus his former general
Jasman, who had become presumptuous on account of his victory over the
Byzantines. He would eventually have made up for this defeat, but
an illness overcame him while encamped before Tarsus. He obeyed his
doctor's orders as little as the caliph's, and his malady, aggravated
by improper diet, caused his death in his fifty-first year at Fostât in
884, whither he had withdrawn. He left seventeen sons,&mdash;enough to assure
a dynasty of a hundred years. Khumarawaih, who inherited the kingdom,
had not many of his father's characteristics. He was a good-natured,
pleasure-loving young man, barely twenty years old, and with a marked
distaste for war. He did, however, notwithstanding his peace-loving
proclivities, fight the caliph's forces near Damascus, and defeat them,
never having seen a battle before. The emir fled from the scene in a
panic.
</p>
<p>
When Muatadid became caliph in 892, he offered his daughter Katr en-Neda
(Dewdrop) in marriage to the caliph's son. The Arabic historians relate
that Khuma-rawaih was fearful of assassination, and had his couch
guarded by a trained lion, but he was finally put to death (a.h. 282),
according to some accounts by women, and according to others by his
eunuchs. The death of Khu-marawaih was the virtual downfall of the
Tulunid dynasty.
</p>
<p>
The officers of the army then at first made Gaish Abu'l-Asakir (one of
Khumarawaih's sons) emir; but, when this fourteen-year-old boy seemed
incapable of anything but stupid jokes, they put his brother Harun on
the throne. Every commanding officer, however, did as he liked. Rajib,
the commander of the army of defence, declared himself on the side of
the caliph, and the Syrian emirs gave themselves up to his general,
Muhammed ibn Suleiman, without any resistance. At the close of the year
he was before Fostât, and at the same time a fleet appeared at Damietta.
A quarrel arose amongst Harun's body-guard, in which the unlucky prince
was killed (904). His uncle Shaiban, a worthy son of Ahmed, made a last
stand, but was obliged to give in to the superior force.
</p>
<p>
Muhammed behaved with his Turks in the most outrageous way in Fostât:
the plundering was unrestrained, and that part of Fostât which Ahmed
had built was almost entirely destroyed. The adherents of the reigning
family were grossly maltreated, many of them killed, and others sent to
Baghdad. The governors changed in rapid succession; disorder, want, and
wretchedness existed throughout the entire country west of the caliph's
kingdom. At this period the provinces of the empire had already fallen
into the hands of the numerous minor princes, who, presuming on the
caliph's weakness, had declared themselves independent sovereigns.
Nothing remained to the Abbasids but Baghdad, a few neighbouring
provinces, and Egypt.
</p>
<p>
Under the Caliphs Muktadir, Kahir, and Rahdi, Egypt had an almost
constant change of governors. One of them, Abu Bekr Muhammed, ultimately
became the founder of a new dynasty,&mdash;the Ikshidite,&mdash;destined to rule
over Egypt and Syria. Abu Bekr Muhammed was the son of Takadj, then
governor of Damascus. His father had been chief emir at the court of the
Tulunid princes, and, after the fall of this dynasty, remained in Egypt,
where he occupied a post under the government. Intrigues, however, drove
him to Syria, whither his partisans followed him. He first entered the
army of the caliph, and, capturing the town of Ramleh, was given the
governorship of Damascus as reward. His son Abu Bekr Muhammed did not go
to Egypt to fulfil the duties with which he had been invested, and only
retained the title for one month. He was subsequently reinstated,
and this time repaired thither. But Ahmed ibn Kighlagh, who was then
governing Egypt, refused to retire and was only defeated after several
engagements, when he and his followers proceeded to Barca in Africa.
</p>
<p>
In the year 328 of the Hegira, the caliph Radhi bestowed the honour of
Emir el-Umara (Prince of Princes) upon Muhammed ibn Raik. This officer,
discontented with the government of Palestine, led an army into Syria
and expelled Badra, the lieutenant of Muhammed el-Ikshid. The latter
left Egypt at once, entrusting the government of that country to his
brother, el-Hassan, and brought his forces to Faramah, where the troops
of Muhammed ibn Raik were already stationed. Thanks to the mediation
of several emirs, matters were concluded peacefully, and Muhammed
el-Ikhshid returned to Fostât. Upon his arrival, however, he learnt that
Muhammed ibn Raik had again left Damascus and was preparing to march
upon Egypt.
</p>
<p>
This intelligence obliged Muhammed el-Ikshid to return at once to Syria.
He encountered the advance-guard of the enemy and promptly led the
attack; his right wing was scattered, but the centre, commanded
by himself, remained firm, and Muhammed ibn Raik retreated towards
Damascus. Husain, brother of el-Ikshid, lost his life in the combat.
Despite the enmity between them, Muhammed ibn Raik sent his own son
to el-Ikshid, charged with messages of condolence for the loss he had
sustained and bearing proposals of peace. Muhammed el-Ikshid received
the son of his enemy with much respect, and invested him with a mantle
of honour. He then consented to cede Damascus, in consideration of an
annual tribute of 140,000 pieces of gold, and the restoration of all
that portion of Palestine between Ramleh and the frontiers of Egypt.
After having concluded all the arrangements relative to this treaty,
Muhammed el-Ikshid returned to Egypt in the year 329 of the Hegira.

<p>
The Caliph Rahdi died in the same year (940 a. d.). He was thirty
years of age, and had reigned six years, ten months, and ten days. His
brother, Abu Ishak Ibrahim, succeeded him, and was henceforth known by
the name of Muttaki. A year later Muhammed el-Ikshid was acknowledged
Prince of Egypt by the new caliph. Shortly after, he learnt that his
former enemy, Muhammed ibn Raik had been killed by the Hamdanites;
he thereupon seized the opportunity to recover those provinces he had
granted him, and, marching into Syria, captured Damascus and all the
possessions he had relinquished upon the conclusion of their treaty.
Feeling now that his position was secure, he caused his son Kasim to be
recognised by the emirs and the entire army as his successor.
</p>
<p>
The year 332 of the Hegira was a disastrous one in Baghdad. The office
of Prince of Princes, bestowed according to the caprice of the Turkish
officers upon any of their leaders, was now become a position superior
even to that of caliph. It was held at this time by a Turk named Turun,
who so oppressed the caliph Muttaki that the latter was forced to fly
from his capital and retire to Mosul. He then besought help from the
Hamdanites, who immediately rallied their forces and, accompanied by the
caliph, marched upon Baghdad. They were, however, completely routed by
Turun and obliged to retreat. Muttaki showed his gratitude to the two
princes by conferring a mantle of honour upon them, which, for some
time past, had been the only gift that Islam sovereigns had been able to
bestow.
</p>
<p>
Leaving Mosul, the caliph proceeded to Rakkah, and there was invited by
Turun to return to Baghdad. Seeing that his adherents, the Hamdanites,
were greatly discouraged by their recent reverses, Muttaki resolved to
accept the offer. When Muhammed el-Ikshid heard this, he hastened to
Rakkah and offered the caliph refuge in Egypt. But the caliph refused,
agreeing, however, as Muhammed el-Ikshid promised to supply him with the
necessary funds, not to return to Baghdad and place himself in the power
of Turun. In spite of his promise, when Turun, fearing that the caliph
had found powerful friends, came to him, and, casting himself before
Muttaki, paid him all the homage due to an Islam sovereign, he allowed
himself to be overruled, and accompanied Turun back to Baghdad. Hardly
had the unfortunate caliph set foot in his capital when he was murdered,
after reigning four years and eleven months. Turun now proclaimed
Abd Allah Abu'l Kasim, son of Muttaki, caliph, who, after a short and
uneventful reign, was succeeded by his uncle, Abu'l Kasim el-Fadhl,
who was the last of the Abbasid caliphs whom Egypt acknowledged as
suzerains.
</p>
<p>
After Muttaki's return to Baghdad, Muhammed el-Ikshid remained for some
time in Damascus, and then set out for Egypt. His return was signalised
by the war with Saif ed-Dowlah, Prince of Hamdan. The campaign was of
varying success: After a disastrous battle, in which the Egyptians lost
four thousand men as prisoners, Muhammed el-Ikshid left Egypt with
a numerous army and arrived at Maarrah. Saif ed-Dowlah determined to
decide the war with one desperate effort, and first secured the
safety of his treasure, his baggage, and his harem by sending them to
Mesopotamia. Then he marched upon el-Ikshid, who had taken his position
at Kinesrin.
</p>
<p>
Muhammed divided his forces into two corps, placing in the vanguard all
those who carried lances; he himself was in the rear with ten thousand
picked men. Saif ed-Dowlah charged the vanguard and routed it, but the
rear stood firm; this resistance saved el-Ikshid from total defeat. The
two armies separated after a somewhat indecisive engagement, and
Saif ed-Dowlah, who could claim no advantage save the capture of his
adversaries' baggage, went on to Maubej, where he destroyed the bridge,
and, entering Mesopotamia, proceeded towards Rakkah; but Muhammed
el-Ikshid was already stationed there, and the hostile armies, separated
only by the Euphrates, faced one another for several days.
</p>
<p>
Negotiations were then opened, and peace was concluded. The conditions
were that Hemessa, Aleppo, and Mesopotamia should belong to Saif
ed-Dowlah, and all the country from Hemessa to the frontiers of Egypt
remain in the possession of Muhammed el-Ikshid. A trench was dug between
Djouchna and Lebouah, in those places where there were no natural
boundaries, to mark the separation of the two states. To ratify this
solemn peace, Saif ed-Dowlah married the daughter of Muhammed el-Ikshid;
then each prince returned to his own province. The treaty was, however,
almost immediately set aside by the Hamdanites, and el-Ikshid, forced to
retrace his steps, defeated them in several engagements and seized the
town of Aleppo.
</p>
<p>
Thus we see that the year 334 of the Hegira (a. d. 946) was full
of important events, to which was soon added the death of Muhammed
el-Ikshid. He died at Damascus, in the last month of the year
(Dhu'l-Kada), aged sixty, and had reigned eleven years, three months,
and two days. He was buried at Jerusalem. Muhammed el-Ikshid was a man
possessing many excellent talents, and chiefly renowned as an admirable
soldier. Brave, without being rash, quick to calculate his chances, he
was able always to seize the advantage. On the other hand, however,
he was so distrustful and timid in the privacy of his palace that he
organised a guard of eight thousand armed slaves, one thousand of
whom kept constant watch. He never spent the entire night in the same
apartment or tent, and no one was ever permitted to know the place where
he slept.
</p>
<p>
We are told that this prince could muster four hundred thousand men;
although historians do not definitely specify the boundaries of his
empire, which, of course, varied from time to time, we may nevertheless
believe that his kingdom, as that of his predecessors, the Tulunites,
extended over Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Mesopotamia, as far as the
Euphrates, and even included a large portion of Arabia. The Christians
of the East charge him with supporting his immense army at their
expense, and persecuting and taxing them to such an extent that they
were forced to sell many possessions belonging to their Church before
they could pay the required sums.
</p>
<p>
But, if we may credit a contemporary historian more worthy of belief,
these expenses were covered by the treasure Muhammed el-Ikshid himself
discovered. In fact, el-Massudi, who died at Cairo in the year 346 of
the Hegira, relates that el-Ikshid, knowing much treasure to be buried
there, was greatly interested in the excavation of the subterraneous
tombs of the ancient Egyptian kings. "The prince" he adds, "was
fortunate enough to come across a portion of those tombs, consisting of
vast rooms magnificently decorated. There he found marvellously wrought
figures of old and young men, women, and children, having eyes of
precious stones and faces of gold and silver."
</p>
<p>
Muhammed el-Ikshid was succeeded by his son, Abu'l Kasim Muhammed,
surnamed Ungur. The prince being only an infant, Kafur, the favourite
minister of the late caliph, was appointed regent. This Kafur was a
black slave purchased by el-Ikshid for the trifling sum of twenty pieces
of gold. He was intelligent, zealous, and faithful, and soon won the
confidence of his master. Nobility of race in the East appertains only
to the descendants of the Prophet, but merit, which may be found in
prince and subject alike, often secures the highest positions, and even
the throne itself for those of the humblest origin. Such was the fate
of Kafur. He showed taste for the sciences, and encouraged scholars;
he loaded the poets with benefits, and they sang his praises without
measure so long as he continued his favours, but satirised him with
equal vigour as soon as his munificence diminished. Invested with
supreme authority, Kafur served the young prince with a devotion and
fidelity worthy of the highest praise. His first step was to dismiss Abu
Bekr Muhammed, the receiver of the Egyptian tributes, against whom he
had received well-merited complaints. In his place he appointed a native
of Mardin, also called Muhammed, of whose honesty and kindliness he was
well aware. He then took his pupil to Egypt, which country they reached
in the month of Safar in the year 335 of the Hegira.
</p>
<p>
Saif ed-Dowlah, hearing of the death of Muhammed el-Ikshid, and the
departure of Ungur, deemed this a favourable opportunity to despoil his
brother-in-law; he therefore marched upon Damascus, which he captured;
but the faithful Kafur promptly arrived upon the scene with a powerful
army, and, routing Saif ed-Dowlah, who had advanced as far as Ramleh,
drove him back to Rakkah, and relieved Damascus. The remainder of the
reign of Ungur passed peacefully, thanks to the watchfulness and wise
government of Kafur.
</p>
<p>
In the year 345 of the Hegira, the King of Nubia invaded the Egyptian
territories, advancing to Syene, which he pillaged and laid waste.
Kafur at once despatched his forces overland and along the Nile, and
simultaneously ordered a detachment embarking from the Red Sea to
proceed along the southern coast, attack the enemy in the rear and
completely cut off their retreat. The Nubians, thus surprised on all
sides, were defeated and forced to retreat, leaving the fortress of Rym,
now known as Ibrim, and situated fifty miles from Syênê, in the hands of
the Egyptians. No other events of note took place during the lifetime of
Ungur, who, having reigned fourteen years and ten days, died in the year
349 of the Hegira, leaving his brother Ali, surnamed Abu'l-Hasan, as his
successor.
</p>
<a name="image-0021"><!--IMG--></a>

alt="371.jpg Mosque Tomb Near Syene 
">
</center>

<p>
The reign of Abu'l-Hasan Ali, the second son of Muhammed el-Ikshid,
lasted but five years. His name, as that of his brother Ungur (Abu
Hurr), is but little known in history. Kafur was also regent during the
reign of Abu'l-Hasan Ali.
</p>
<p>
In the year 352 of the Hegira, Egypt was stricken with a disastrous
famine. The rise of the Nile, which the previous year had been but
fifteen cubits, was this year even less, and suddenly the waters fell
without irrigating the country. Egypt and the dependent provinces were
thus afflicted for nine consecutive years. During this time, whilst
the people were agitated by fear for the future, a rupture took place
between Abu'l-Hasan Ali and Kafur. This internal disturbance was soon
followed by war; and in the year 354 the Greeks of Constantinople,
led by the Emperor Nicepherous Phocas, advanced into Syria. They took
Aleppo, then in the possession of the Hamdanites, and, encountering
Saif ed-Dowlah, overthrew him also. The governor of Damascus, Dalim
el-Ukazly, and ten thousand men came to the rescue of the Hamdanites,
but Phocas beat a retreat on hearing of his approach.
</p>
<p>
Abu'l-Hasan Ali died in the year 355 of the Hegira. The regent
Kafur then ascended the throne, assuming the surname el-Ikshid. He
acknowledged the paramount authority of the Abbasid caliph, Muti, and
that potentate recognised his supreme power in the kingdom of Egypt.
During the reign of Kafur, which only lasted two years and four months,
the greater portion of Said was seized by the Fatimites, already
masters of Fayum and Alexandria, and the conquerors were on the point of
encroaching still farther, when Kafur died in the year 357 a.h. Ahmed,
surnamed Abu'l Fawaris, the son of Abu'l-Hasan Ali, and consequently
grandson of Mu-hammed el-Ikshid, succeeded Kafur.
</p>
<p>
The prince was only eleven years old, and therefore incapable of
properly controlling Egypt, Syria, and his other domains. Husain, one
of his relatives, invaded Syria, but in his turn driven back by the
Karmates, returned to Egypt and strove to depose Ahmed. These divisions
in the reigning family severed the ties which united the provinces of
the Egyptian kingdom. To terminate the disturbances, the emirs resolved
to seek the protection of the Fatimites. The latter, anxious to secure
the long-coveted prize, gladly rendered assistance, and Husain was
forced to return to Syria, where he took possession of Damascus, and the
unfortunate Ahmed lost the throne of Egypt.
</p>
<p>
With him perished the Ikshid dynasty, which, more ephemeral even than
that of the Tulunid, flourished only thirty-four years and twenty-four
days.
</p>
<p>
The period upon which this history is now about to enter is of more than
usual interest, for it leads immediately to the centuries during which
the Arabic forces came into contact with the forces of Western Europe.
The town and the coast of Mauritania were then ruled by the Fatimites,
a dynasty independent of the Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad. The Fatimites
belonged to the tribes of Koramah, who dwelt in the mountains situated
near the town of Fez in the extreme west of Africa. In the year 269 of
the Hegira, they began to extend their sway in the western regions of
Africa, pursuing their conquests farther east. The Fatimite caliph Obaid
Allah and his son Abu'l Kasim cherished designs not only upon Egypt,
but even aimed at the destruction of the Abbasid caliphate, these plans
being so far successful as to leave the Fatimites in secure possession
of Alexandria, and more or less in power in Fayum.
</p>
<p>
The Fatimite caliphs had lofty and pretentious claims to the allegiance
of the Moslem world. They traced their descent from Fatima, a daughter
of the Prophet, whom Muhammed himself regarded as one of the four
perfect women. At the age of fifteen she married Ali, of whom she was
the only wife, and the partisans of Ali, as we have seen, disputed with
Omar the right to the leadership of Islam upon the Prophet's death.
Critics are not wanting who dispute the family origin of Obaid Allah,
but his claim appears to have been unhesitatingly admitted by his own
immediate followers. The Fatimite successes in the Mediterranean gave
them a substantial basis of political power, and doubtless this outward
and material success was more important to them than their claim to both
a physical and mythical descent from the founder of their religion.
</p>
<p>
Some accounts trace the descent of Obaid from Abd Allah ibn Maimun
el-Kaddah, the founder of the Ismailian sect, of which the Carmathians
were a branch. The Ismailians may be best regarded as one of the several
sects of Shiites, who originally were simply the partisans of Ali
against Omar, but by degrees they became identified as the upholders of
the Koran against the validity of the oral tradition, and when, later,
the whole of Persia espoused the cause of Ali, the Shiite belief
became tinged with all kinds of mysticism. The Ismailians believed, for
instance, in the coming of a Messiah, to whom they gave the name Mahdi,
and who would one day appear on earth to establish the reign of justice,
and revenge the wrongs done to the family of Ali. The Ismailians
regarded Obaid himself as the Mahdi, and they also believed in
incarnations of the "universal soul," which in former ages had appeared
as the Hebrew Prophets, but which to the Muhammedan manifested itself as
imans. The iman is properly the leader of public worship, but it is not
so much an office as a seership with mystical attributes. The Muhammedan
imans so far have numbered eleven, the twelfth, and greatest (El-Mahdi),
being yet to come. The Ismailians also introduced mysticism into the
interpretation of the Koran, and even taught that its moral precepts
were not to be taken in a literal sense. Thus the Fatimite caliphs
founded their authority upon a combination of political power and
superstition.
</p>
<p>
Abu'l Kasim, who ruled at Alexandria, was succeeded in 945 by his son,
El-Mansur. Under his reign the Fatimites were attacked by Abu Yazid, a
Berber, who gathered around him the Sunnites, and the revolutionaries
succeeded in taking the Fatimite capital Kairwan. El-Mansur, however,
soon defeated Abu Yazid in a decisive battle and rebuilt a new city,
Mansuria, on the site of the modern Cairo, to commemorate the event.
Dying in 953, he was succeeded by Muiz ad-Din.
</p>
<p>
Muiz came to the throne just at the time when dissensions as to the
succession were undermining the Ikshid dynasty. Seizing the opportunity
in the year 969, Muiz equipped a large and well-armed force, with a
formidable body of cavalry, the whole under the command of Abu'l-Husain
Gohar el-Kaid, a native of Greece and a slave of his father El-Mansur.
This general, on his arrival near Alexandria, received a deputation from
the inhabitants of Fostât charged to negotiate a treaty. Their overtures
were favourably entertained, and the conquest of the country seemed
probable without bloodshed. But while the conditions were being
ratified, the Ikshidites prevailed on the people to revoke their offer,
and the ambassadors, on their return, were themselves compelled to seek
safety in flight.
</p>
<p>
Gohar el-Kaid incurred no delay in pushing his troops forward. He forced
the passage of the Nile a few miles south of El-Gizeh at the head of his
troops, and the Ikshidites suffered a disastrous defeat. To the honour
of the African general, it is related that the inhabitants of Fostât
were pardoned and the city was peaceably occupied. The submission of the
rest of Egypt to Muiz was secured by this victory. In the year 359 a.h.
Syria was also added to his domains, but shortly after was overrun by
the Carmathians. The troops of Muiz met with several reverses, Damascus
was taken, and those lawless freebooters, joined by the Ikshidites,
advanced to Ain Shems. In the meanwhile, Gohar had fortified Cairo (the
new capital which he had founded immediately north of Fostât) and taken
every precaution to repel the invaders; a bloody battle was fought in
the year 361 before the city walls, without any decisive result. Later,
however, Gohar obtained a victory over the enemy which proved to be a
decisive one.
</p>
<p>
Muiz subsequently removed his court to his new kingdom. In Ramadhan 362,
he entered Cairo, bringing with him the bodies of his three predecessors
and vast treasure. Muiz reigned about two years in Egypt, dying in the
year 365 a.h. He is described as a warlike and ambitious prince, but,
notwithstanding, he was especially distinguished for justice and was
fond of learning. He showed great favour to the Christians, especially
to Severus, Bishop of El-Ashmunein, and the patriarch Ephrem; and under
his orders, and with his assistance, the church of the Mu'allakah,
in Old Misr, was rebuilt. He executed many useful works (among others
rendering navigable the Tanitic branch of the Nile, which is still
called the canal of Muiz), and occupied himself in embellishing Cairo.
Gohar, when he founded that city, built the great mosque named El-Azhar,
the university of Egypt, which to this day is crowded with students from
all parts of the Moslem world.
</p>
<p>
Aziz Abu-Mansur Nizar, on coming to the throne of his father,
immediately despatched an expedition against the Turkish chief
El-Eftekeen, who had taken Damascus a short time previously. Gohar again
commanded the army, and pressed the siege of that city so vigorously
that the enemy called to their aid the Carmathians. Before this united
army he was forced to retire slowly to Ascalon, where he prepared to
stand a siege; but, being reduced to great straits, he purchased his
liberty with a large sum of money. On his return from this disastrous
campaign, Aziz took command in person, and, meeting the enemy at Ramleh,
was victorious after a bloody battle; while El-Eftekeen, being betrayed
into his hands, was with Arab magnanimity received with honour and
confidence, and ended his days in Egypt in affluence. Aziz followed his
father's example of liberality. It is even said that he appointed a Jew
his vizier in Syria, and a Christian to the same post in Egypt. These
acts, however, nearly cost him his life, and a popular tumult obliged
him to disgrace both these officers. After a reign of twenty-one years
of great internal prosperity, he died (a.h. 386) in a bath at Bilbeis,
while preparing an expedition against the Greeks who were ravaging
his possessions in Syria. Aziz was distinguished for moderation and
mildness, but his son and successor rendered himself notorious for very
opposite qualities.
</p>
<p>
Hakim Abu Ali Mansur commenced his reign, according to Moslem
historians, with much wisdom, but afterwards acquired a reputation for
impiety, cruelty, and unreasoning extravagance, by which he has been
rendered odious to posterity. He is said to have had at the same time
"courage and boldness, cowardice and timorousness, a love for learning
and vindictiveness towards the learned, an inclination to righteousness
and a disposition to slay the righteous." He also arrogated to himself
divinity, and commanded his subjects to rise at the mention of his name
in the congregational prayers, an edict which was obeyed even in the
holy cities, Mecca and Medina. He is most famous in connection with the
Druses, a sect which he founded and which still holds him in veneration
and believes in his future return to the earth. He had made himself
obnoxious to all classes of his subjects when, in the year 397 a.h., he
nearly lost his throne by foreign invasion.

Hisham, surnamed Abu-Rekweh, a descendant of the house of Ommaya in
Spain, took the province of Barca with a considerable force and subdued
Upper Egypt. The caliph, aware of his danger, immediately collected
his troops from every quarter of the kingdom, and marched against the
invaders, whom, after severe fighting, he defeated and put to flight.
Hisham himself was taken prisoner, paraded in Cairo with every
aggravation of cruelty, and put to death. Hakim having thus by vigorous
measures averted this danger, Egypt continued to groan under his tyranny
until the year 411 a.h., when he fell by domestic treachery. His sister
Sitt el-Mulk had, in common with the rest of his subjects, incurred his
displeasure; and, being fearful for her life, she secretly and by night
concerted measures with the emir Saif ed-Dowlah, chief of the guard,
who very readily agreed to her plans. Ten slaves, bribed by five hundred
dinars each ($1,260), having received their instructions, went forth on
the appointed day to the desert tract southward of Cairo, where Hakim,
unattended, was in the habit of riding, and waylaid him near the village
of Helwan, where they put him to death.
</p>
<p>
Within a week Hakim's son Ali had been raised to the caliphate with
the title of Dhahir, at the command of Sitt el-Mulk. As Dhahir was only
eighteen years old, and in no way educated for the government, Sitt
el-Mulk took the reins of government, and was soon looked upon as the
instigator of Hakim's death. This suspicion was strengthened by the
fact that his sister had the heir to the throne&mdash;who was at that time
governor of Aleppo&mdash;murdered, and also the chief who had conspired with
her in assassinating Hakim. She survived her brother for about four
years, but the actual ruler was the Vizier Ali el-Jar jar.
</p>
<p>
Dhahir's reign offers many points of interest. Peace and contentment
reigned in the interior, and Syria continued to be the chief point of
interest to the Egyptian politics. Both Lulu and his son Mansur, who
received princely titles from Hakim, recognised the suzerainty of the
Fatimites. Later on a disagreement arose between Lulu's son and Dhahir.
One of the former's slaves conspired against his master, and gave Aleppo
into the hands of the Fatimites, whose governor maintained himself there
till 1023. In this year, however, Aleppo fell into the power of the Benu
Kilab, who defended the town with great success against Romanus in
1030. Not till Dhahir's successor came to the throne in 1036 was Aleppo
reconquered by the Fatimites, but only to fall, after a few years, again
into the hands of a Kilabite, whom the caliph was obliged to acknowledge
as governor until he of his own free will exchanged the city for several
other towns in Syria; but even then the strife about the possession of
Aleppo was not yet at an end.
</p>
<p>
Mustanssir ascended the throne at the age of four years. His mother,
although black and once a slave, had great influence in the choice of
the viziers and other officials, and even when the caliph became of age,
he showed very few signs of independence. His reign, which lasted sixty
years, offers a constant alternation of success and defeat. At one time
his dominion was limited to the capital Cairo, at another time he was
recognised as lord of Africa, Sicily, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and even of
the Abbassid capital, Baghdad. A few days later his dominion was again
on the point of being extinguished. The murder of a Turk by the negroes
led to a war between the Turkish mercenaries and the blacks who formed
the caliph's body-guard. The latter were joined by many of the other
slaves, but the Turks were supported by the Ketama Berbers and some of
the Bedouin tribes, and also the Hamdanite Nasir ed-Dowlah, who had
long been in the Egyptian service. The blacks, although supported by the
caliph's mother, were completely defeated, and the caliph was forced to
acknowledge the authority of Nasir ed-Dowlah. He thereupon threatened
to abdicate, but when he learned that his palace with all its treasures
would then be given up to plunder, he refrained from fulfilling his
threat. The power of the Hamdanites and the Turks increased with
every victory over the negroes, who finally could no longer maintain
themselves at all in Upper Egypt. The caliph was treated with contempt,
and had to give up his numerous treasures, one by one, to satisfy the
avarice of his troops. Even the graves of his ancestors were at last
robbed of all they contained, and when, at last, everything had been
ransacked, even his library, which was one of the largest and finest,
was not spared. The best manuscripts were dispersed, some went to
Africa, others were destroyed, many were damaged or purposely mutilated
by the Sunnites, simply because they had been written by the Shiites;
still others were burnt by the Turks as worthless material, and the
leather bands which held them made into sandals.

<p>
Meanwhile war between Mustanssir and Nasir ed-Dowlah continued to be
waged in Egypt and Syria, until at last the latter became master of
Cairo and deprived the caliph once more completely of his independence.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, a conspiracy with Ildeghiz, a Turkish general, at its head,
was formed against Nasir ed-Dowlah, and he, together with his relations
and followers, was brutally murdered. Ildeghiz behaved in the same way
as his predecessor had-done towards the caliph, and the latter appealed
to Bedr el-Jemali for help. Bedr proceeded to Acre with his best Syrian
troops, landed in the neighbourhood of Damietta and proceeded towards
the capital, which he entered without difficulty (January, 1075). He was
appointed general and first vizier, so that he now held both the highest
military and civil authority.
</p>
<p>
In order to strengthen his position, he had all the commanders of the
troops and the highest officials murdered at a ball. Under his rule,
peace and order were at last restored to Egypt, and the income of the
state was increased under his excellent government.
</p>
<p>
Bedr remained at his post till his death, and his son El-Afdhal was
appointed by Mustanssir to succeed him. Upon the death of Mustanssir
(1094), his successor El-Mustali Abu'l Kasim retained El-Afdhal in
office. He was afterwards murdered under Emir (December, 1121) because,
according to some, he was not a zealous enough Shiite, but, according
to others, because the caliph wished to gain possession of the enormous
treasures of the vizier and to be absolutely independent. Emir was
also murdered (October 7, 1130), and was succeeded by his cousin, who
ascended the throne under the name of Hafiz, and appointed a son of
El-Afdhal as vizier, who, just as his father had done, soon became the
real ruler, and did not even allow the caliph's name to be mentioned in
the prayers; whereupon he also was murdered at the caliph's instigation.
After other viziers had met with a similar fate, and amongst them a son
of the caliph himself, at last Hafiz ruled alone. His son and successor,
Dhafir (1149-1150), also frequently changed his viziers because they
one and all wished to obtain too much influence. The last vizier,
Abbas, murdered the caliph (March-April, 1154), and placed El-Faiz, the
five-year-old son of the dead caliph, on the throne, but the child died
in his eleventh year (July, 1160). Salih, then vizier, raised Adid, a
descendant of Alhagiz, to the caliphate and gave him his daughter to
wife, for which reason he was murdered at the desire of the harem. His
son Adil maintained himself for a short time, and then El-Dhargham and
Shawir fought for the post; as the former gained the victory, Shawir
fled to Syria, called Nureddin to his aid, and their army, under Shirkuh
and Saladin, put an end in 1171 to the rule of the Fatimites.
