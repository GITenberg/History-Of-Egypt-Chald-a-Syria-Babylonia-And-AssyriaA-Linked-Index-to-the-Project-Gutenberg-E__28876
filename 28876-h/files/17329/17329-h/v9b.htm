<h2>
    CHAPTER II&mdash;THE LAST DAYS OF THE OLD EASTERN WORLD
</h2>
<p>
<i>The Median wars&mdash;The last native dynasties of Egypt&mdash;The Eastern world
on the eve of the Macedonian conquest.</i>
</p>
<pre>
     [Drawn by Boudier, from one of the sarcophagi of Sidon, now
     in the Museum of St. Irene. The vignette, which is by
     Faucher-Gudin, represents the sitting cyno-cephalus of
     Nectanebo I., now in the Egyptian Museum at the Vatican.]
</pre>
<p>
Darius appears to have formed this project of conquest immediately after
his first victories, when his initial attempts to institute satrapies
had taught him not only the condition and needs of Asia Minor, but of
the teaching the Scythians such a lesson as would prevent them from
bearing down upon his right flank during his march, or upon his rear
while engaged in a crucial struggle in the Hellenic peninsula. On the
other hand, the geographical information possessed by the Persians with
regard to the Danubian regions was of so vague a character, that Darius
must have believed the Scythians to have been nearer to his line of
operations, and their country less desolate than was really the case.* A
flotilla, commanded by Ariaramnes, satrap of Cappadocia, ventured across
the Black Sea in 515,** landed a few thousand men upon the opposite
shore, and brought back prisoners who furnished those in command with
the information they required.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The motives imputed to Darius by the ancients for making
     this expedition are the desire of avenging the disasters of
     the Scythian invasion, or of performing an exploit which
     should render him as famous as his predecessors in the eyes
     of posterity.

     ** The reconnaissance of Ariaramnes is intimately connected
     with the expedition itself in Ctesias, and could have
     preceded it by a few months only. If we take for the date of
     the latter the year 514-513, the date given in the Table of
     the Capitol, that of the former cannot be earlier than 515.
     Ariaramnes was not satrap of Cappadocia, for Cappadocia
     belonged then to the satrapy of Daskylion.

     *** The supplementary paragraphs of the Inscription of
     Behistun speak of an expedition of Darius against the Sako,
     which is supposed to have had as its objective either the
     sea of Aral or the Tigris. Would it not be possible to
     suppose that the sea mentioned is the Pontus Euxinus, and to
     take the mutilated text of Behistun to be a description
     either of the campaign beyond the Danube, or rather of the
     preliminary <i>reconnaissance</i> of Ariaramnes a year before the
     expedition itself?
</pre>
<p>
Darius, having learned what he could from these poor wretches, crossed
the Bosphorus in 514, with a body of troops which tradition computed
at 800,000, conquered the eastern coast of Thrace, and won his way in
a series of conflicts as far as the Ister. The Ionian sailors built for
him a bridge of boats, which he entrusted to their care, and he then
started forward into the steppes in search of the enemy. The Scythians
refused a pitched battle, but they burnt the pastures before him on
every side, filled up the wells, carried off the cattle, and then slowly
retreated into the interior, leaving Darius to face the vast extent of
the steppes and the terrors of famine. Later tradition stated that he
wandered for two months in these solitudes between the Ister and the
Tanais; he had constructed on the banks of this latter river a series
of earthworks, the remains of which were shown in the time of Herodotus,
and had at length returned to his point of departure with merely the
loss of a few sick men. The barbarians stole a march upon him, and
advised the Greeks to destroy the bridge, retire within their cities,
and abandon the Persians to their fate. The tyrant of the Ohersonnesus,
Miltiades the Athenian, was inclined to follow their advice; but
Histiasus, the governor of Miletus, opposed it, and eventually carried
his point. Darius reached the southern bank without difficulty, and
returned to Asia.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Ctesias limits the campaign beyond the Danube to a fifteen
     days' march; and Strabo places the crossing of the Danube
     near the mouth of that river, at the island of Peukê, and
     makes the expedition stop at the Dniester. Neither the line
     of direction of the Persian advance nor their farthest point
     reached is known. The eight forts which they were said to
     have built, the ruins of which were shown on the banks of
     the Oaros as late as the time of Herodotus, were probably
     tumuli similar to those now met with on the Russian steppes,
     the origin of which is ascribed by the people to persons
     celebrated in their history or traditions.
</pre>
<p>
The Greek towns of Thrace thought themselves rid of him, and rose in
revolt; but he left 80,000 men in Europe who, at first under Megabyzos,
and then under Otanes, reduced them to subjection one after another, and
even obliged Amyntas I., the King of Macedonia, to become a tributary of
the empire. The expedition had not only failed to secure the submission
of the Scythians, but apparently provoked reprisals on their part, and
several of their bands penetrated ere long into the Chersonnesus. It
nevertheless was not without solid result, for it showed that Darius,
even if he could not succeed in subjugating the savage Danubian tribes,
had but little to fear from them; it also secured for him a fresh
province, that of Thrace, and, by the possession of Macedonia, brought
his frontier into contact with Northern Greece. The overland route, in
any case the more satisfactory of the two, was now in the hands of the
invader.
</p>
<p>
Revolutions at Athens prevented him from setting out on his expedition
as soon as he had anticipated. Hippias had been overthrown in 510, and
having taken refuge at Sigoum, was seeking on all sides for some one
to avenge him against his fellow-citizens. The satrap of Sardes,
Arta-phernes, declined at first to listen to him, for he hoped that the
Athenians themselves would appeal to him, without his being obliged to
have recourse to their former tyrant. As a matter of fact, they sent him
an embassy, and begged his help against the Spartans. He promised it
on condition that they would yield the traditional homage of earth and
water, and their delegates complied with his demand, though on their
return to Athens they were disowned by the citizens (508). Artaphernes,
disappointed in this direction, now entered into communications with
Hippias, and such close relations soon existed between the two that
the Athenians showed signs of uneasiness. Two years later they again
despatched fresh deputies to Sardes to beg the satrap not to espouse
the cause of their former ruler. For a reply the satrap summoned them
to recall the exiles, and, on their refusing (506),* their city became
thenceforward the ostensible objective of the Persian army and fleet.
The partisans of Hippias within the town were both numerous and active;
it was expected that they would rise and hand over the city as soon as
their chief should land on a point of territory with a force sufficient
to intimidate the opposing faction. Athens in the hands of Hippias,
would mean Athens in the hands of the Persians, and Greece accessible to
the Persian hordes at all times by the shortest route. Darius therefore
prepared to make the attempt, and in order to guard against any mishap,
he caused all the countries that he was about to attack to be explored
beforehand. Spies attached to his service were sent to scour the coasts
of the Peloponnesus and take note of all its features, the state of
its ports, the position of the islands and the fortresses; and they
penetrated as far as Italy, if we may believe the story subsequently
told to Herodotus.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus fixes the date at the time when the Athenians
     first ostracised the principal partisans of the
     Pisistratids, and amongst others Hipparchus, son of Charmes,
     i.e. in 507-6.

     ** Herodotus said that Darius sent spies with the physician
     Democedes of Crotona shortly before the Scythian expedition.
</pre>
<p>
While he thus studied the territory from a distance, he did not neglect
precautions nearer to hand, but ordered the Milesians to occupy in
his name the principal stations of the Ægean between Ionia and Attica.
Histiasus, whose loyalty had stood Darius in such good stead at the
bridge over the Danube, did not, however, appear to him equal to so
delicate a task: the king summoned him to Susa on some slight pretext,
loaded him with honours, and replaced him by his nephew Aristagoras.
Aristagoras at once attempted to justify the confidence placed in him by
taking possession of Naxos; but the surprise that he had prepared ended
in failure, discontent crept in among his men, and after a fruitless
siege of four months he was obliged to withdraw (499).* His failure
changed the tide of affairs. He was afraid that the Persians would
regard it as a crime, and this fear prompted him to risk everything to
save his fortune and his life. He retired from his office as tyrant,
exhorted the Milesians, who were henceforth free to do so, to make war
on the barbarians, and seduced from their allegiance the crews of the
vessels just returned from Naxos, and still lying in the mouths of the
Meander; the tyrants who commanded them were seized, some exiled,
and some put to death. The Æolians soon made common cause with their
neighbours the Ionians, and by the last days of autumn the whole of the
Ægean littoral was under arms (499).**
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus attributes an unlikely act of treachery to
     Megabates the Persian, who was commanding the Iranian
     contingent attached to the Ionian troops.

     ** The Dorian cities took no part in the revolt&mdash;at least
     Herodotus never mentions them among the confederates. The
     three Ionian cities of Ephesus, Kolophon, and Lebedos also
     seem to have remained aloof, and we know that the Ephesians
     were not present at the battle of Ladê.

<p>
From the outset Aristagoras realised that they would be promptly
overcome if Asiatic Hellas were not supported by Hellas in Europe.
While the Lydian satrap was demanding reinforcements from his sovereign,
Aristagoras therefore repaired to the Peloponnesus as a suppliant for
help. Sparta, embroiled in one of her periodical quarrels with Argos,
gave him an insolent refusal;* even Athens, where the revolution had
for the moment relieved her from the fear of the Pisistratidaa and
the terrors of a barbarian invasion, granted him merely twenty
triremes&mdash;enough to draw down reprisals on her immediately after their
defeat, without sensibly augmenting the rebels' chances of success; to
the Athenian contingent Bretria added five vessels, and this comprised
his whole force. The leaders of the movement did not hesitate to assume
the offensive with these slender resources. As early as the spring
of 498, before Artaphernes had received reinforcements, they marched
suddenly on Sardes. They burnt the lower town, but, as on many previous
occasions, the citadel held out; after having encamped for several
days at the foot of its rock, they returned to Ephesus laden with the
spoil.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Aristagoras had with him a map of the world engraved on a
     bronze plate, which was probably a copy of the chart drawn
     up by Hecatseus of Miletus.

     ** Herodotus says that the Ionians on their return suffered
     a serious reverse near Ephesus. The author seems to have
     adopted some Lydian or Persian tradition hostile to the
     Ionians, for Charon of Lampsacus, who lived nearer to the
     time of these events, mentions only the retreat, and hints
     at no defeat. If the expedition had really ended in this
     disaster, it is not at all likely that the revolt would have
     attained the dimensions it did immediately afterwards.
</pre>
<p>
This indeed was a check to their hostilities, and such an abortive
attempt was calculated to convince them of their powerlessness against
the foreign rule. None the less, however, when it was generally known
that they had burnt the capital of Asia Minor, and had with impunity
made the representative of the great king feel in his palace the smoke
of the conflagration, the impression was such as actual victory could
have produced. The cities which had hitherto hesitated to join them, now
espoused their cause&mdash;the ports of the Troad and the Hellespont, Lycia,
the Carians, and Cyprus&mdash;and their triumph would possibly have been
secured had Greece beyond the Ægean followed the general movement and
joined the coalition. Sparta, however, persisted in her indifference,
and Athens took the opportunity of withdrawing from the struggle. The
Asiatic Greeks made as good a defence as they could, but their resources
fell far short of those of the enemy, and they could do no more than
delay the catastrophe and save their honour by their bravery. Cyprus
was the first to yield during the winter of 498-497. Its vessels,
in conjunction with those of the Ionians, dispersed the fleet of the
Phoenicians off Salamis, but the troops of their princes, still imbued
with the old system of military tactics, could not sustain the charge
of the Persian battalions; they gave way under the walls of Salamis, and
their chief, Onesilus, was killed in a final charge of his chariotry.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The movement in Cyprus must have begun in the winter of
     499-498, for Onesilus was already in the field when Darius
     heard of the burning of Sardes; and as it lasted for a year,
     it must have been quelled in the winter of 498-497.
</pre>
<p>
His death effected the ruin of the Ionian cause in Cyprus, which on the
continent suffered at the same time no less serious reverses. The towns
of the Hellespont and of Æolia succumbed one after another; Kymê and
Clazomenæ next opened their gates; the Carians were twice beaten, once
near the White Columns, and again near Labranda, and their victory at
Pedasos suspended merely for an instant the progress of the Persian
arms, so that towards the close of 497 the struggle was almost entirely
concentrated round Miletus. Aristagoras, seeing that his cause was
now desperate, agreed with his partisans that they should expatriate
themselves. He fell fighting against the Edonians of Thrace, attempting
to force the important town of Enneahodoi, near the mouth of the Strymon
(496);* but his defection had not discouraged any one, and Histiseus,
who had been sent to Sardes by the great king to negotiate the
submission of the rebels, failed in his errand. Even when blockaded on
the land side, Miletus could defy an attack so long as communication
with the sea was not cut off.
</p>
<pre>
     * In Herodotus the town is not named, but a passage in
     Thucydides shows that it was Enneahodoi, afterwards
     Amphipolis, and that the death of Aristagoras took place
     thirty-two years before the Athenian defeat at Drabeskos,
     i.e. probably in 496.
</pre>

<p>
Darius therefore brought up the Phoenician fleet, reinforced it with
the Cypriot contingents, and despatched the united squadrons to the
Archipelago during the summer of 494. The confederates, even after the
disasters of the preceding years, still possessed 353 vessels, most of
them of 30 to 50 oars; they were, however, completely defeated near the
small island of Ladê, in the latter part of the summer, and Miletus,
from that moment cut off from the rest of the world, capitulated a few
weeks later. A small proportion of its inhabitants continued to dwell
in the ruined city, but the greater number were carried away to Ampê, at
the mouth of the Tigris, in the marshes of the Nâr-Marratum.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The year 497, i.e. three years before the capture of the
     town, appears to be an unlikely date for the battle of Ladê:
     Miletus must have fallen in the autumn or winter months
     following the defeat.

Caria was reconquered during the winter of 494-493, and by the early
part of 493, Chios, Lesbos, Tenedos, the cities of the Chersonnesus
and of Propontis&mdash;in short, all which yet held out&mdash;were reduced to
obedience. Artaphernes reorganised his vanquished states entirely in the
interest of Persia. He did not interfere with the constitutions of
the several republics, but he reinstated the tyrants. He regulated and
augmented the various tributes, prohibited private wars, and gave to the
satrap the right of disposing of all quarrels at his own tribunal. The
measures which he adopted had long after his day the force of law among
the Asiatic Greeks, and it was by them they regulated their relations
with the representatives of the great king.
</p>
<p>
If Darius had ever entertained doubts as to the necessity for occupying
European Greece to ensure the preservation of peace in her Asiatic
sister-country, the revolt of Ionia must have completely dissipated
them. It was a question whether the cities which had so obstinately
defied him for six long years, would ever resign themselves to servitude
as long as they saw the peoples of their race maintaining their
independence on the opposite shores of the Ægean, and while the misdeeds
of which the contingents of Eretria and Athens had been guilty during
the rebellion remained unpunished. A tradition, which sprang up soon
after the event, related that on hearing of the burning of Sardes,
Darius had bent his bow and let fly an arrow towards the sky, praying
Zeus to avenge him on the Athenians: and at the same time he had
commanded one of his slaves to repeat three times a day before him, at
every meal, "Sire, remember the Athenians!"*
</p>
<pre>
     * The legend is clearly older than the time of Herodotus,
     for in the <i>Persæ</i> of Eschylus the shade of Darius, when
     coming out of his tomb, cries to the old men, "Remember
     Athens and Greece!"
</pre>
<p>
As a matter of fact, the intermeddling of these strangers between
the sovereign and his subjects was at once a serious insult to the
Achæmenids and a cause of anxiety to the empire; to leave it unpunished
would have been an avowal of weakness or timidity, which would not fail
to be quickly punished in Syria, Egypt, Babylon, and on the Scythian
frontiers, and would ere long give rise to similar acts of revolt and
interference. Darius, therefore, resumed his projects, but with greater
activity than before, and with a resolute purpose to make a final
reckoning with the Greeks, whatever it might cost him. The influence of
his nephew Mardonius at first inclined him to adopt the overland route,
and he sent him into Thrace with a force of men and a fleet of galleys
sufficient to overcome all obstacles. Mardonius marched against the
Greek colonies and native tribes which had throw off the yoke during the
Ionian war, and reduced those who had still managed to preserve their
independence. The Bryges opposed him with such determination, that
summer was drawing to its close before he was able to continue his
march. He succeeded, however, in laying hands on Macedonia, and obliged
its king, Alexander, to submit to the conditions accepted by his father
Amyntas; but at this juncture half of his fleet was destroyed by a
tempest in the vicinity of Mount Athos, and the disaster, which
took place just as winter was approaching, caused him to suspend his
operations (492). He was recalled on account of his failure, and
the command was transferred to Datis the Mede and to the Persian
Artaphernes. Darius, however, while tentatively using the land routes
through Greece for his expeditions, had left no stone unturned to secure
for himself that much-coveted sea-way which would carry him straight
into the heart of the enemy's position, and he had opened negotiations
with the republics of Greece proper. Several of them had consented to
tender him earth and water, among them being Ægina,* and besides this,
the state of the various factions in Athens was such, that he had every
reason to believe that he could count on the support of a large section
of the population when the day came for him to disembark his force on
the shores of Attica.
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus states that <i>all</i> the island-dwelling Greeks
     submitted to the great king. But Herodotus himself says
     later on that the people of Naxos, at all events, proved
     refractory.

He therefore decided to direct his next expedition against Athens
itself, and he employed the year 491 in concentrating his troops and
triremes in Cilicia, at a sufficient distance from the European coast
to ensure their safety from any sudden attack. In the spring of 490 the
army recruited from among the most warlike nations of the empire&mdash;the
Persians, Medes, and Sakse&mdash;went aboard the Phoenician fleet, while
galleys built on a special model were used as transports for the
cavalry. The entire convoy sailed safely out of the mouth of the Pyramos
to the port of Samos, coasting the shores of Asia Minor, and then
passing through the Cyclades, from Samos to Naxos, where they met
with no opposition from the inhabitants, headed for Delos, where Datis
offered a sacrifice to Apollo, whom he confounded with his god
Mithra; finally they reached Eubæa, where Eretria and Carystos vainly
endeavoured to hold their own against them. Eretria was reduced to
ashes, as Sardes had been, and such of its citizens as had not fled into
the mountains at the enemy's approach were sent into exile among the
Kissians in the township of Arderikka. Hippias meanwhile had joined the
Persians and had been taken into their confidence. While awaiting the
result of the intrigues of his partisans in Athens, he had advised
Datis to land on the eastern coast of Attica, in the neighbourhood of
Marathon, at the very place from whence his father Pisistratus had set
out forty years before to return to his country after his first exile.
The position was well chosen for the expected engagement.

<p>
The bay and the strand which bordered it afforded an excellent station
for the fleet, and the plain, in spite of its marshes and brushwood, was
one of those rare spots where cavalry might be called into play without
serious drawbacks. A few hours on foot would bring the bulk of the
infantry up to the Acropolis by a fairly good road, while by the same
time the fleet would be able to reach the roadstead of Phalerum. All had
been arranged beforehand for concerted action when the expected rising
should take place; but it never did take place, and instead of the
friends whom the Persians expected, an armed force presented itself,
commanded by the polemarch Callimachus and the ten strategi, among whom
figured the famous Miltiades. At the first news of the disembarkation
of the enemy, the republic had despatched the messenger Phidippides to
Sparta to beg for immediate assistance, and in the mean time had sent
forward all her able-bodied troops to meet the invaders. They comprised
about 10,000 hoplites, accompanied, as was customary, by nearly as many
more light infantry, who were shortly reinforced by 1000 Platæans. They
encamped in the valley of Avlona, around a small temple of Heracles, in
a position commanding the roads into the interior, and from whence
they could watch the enemy without exposing themselves to an unexpected
attack.

<p>
The two armies watched each other for a fortnight, Datis expecting a
popular outbreak which would render an engagement unnecessary, Miltiades
waiting patiently till the Lacedaemonians had come up, or till some
false move on the part of his opponent gave him the opportunity of
risking a decisive action. What took place at the end of this time is
uncertain. Whether Datis grew tired of inaction, or whether he suddenly
resolved to send part of his forces by sea, so as to land on the
neighbouring shore of Athens, and Miltiades fell upon his rear when
only half his men had got on board the fleet, is not known. At any rate,
Miltiades, with the Platæans on his left, set his battalions in movement
without warning, and charged the enemy with a rush. The Persians and
the Sakæ broke the centre of the line, but the two wings, after having
dispersed the assailants on their front, wheeled round upon them and
overcame them: 6000 barbarians were left dead upon the field as against
some 200 Athenians and Platæans, but by dint of their valiant efforts
the remainder managed to save the fleet with a loss of only seven
galleys. Datis anchored that evening off the island of Ægilia, and at
the same moment the victorious army perceived a signal hoisted on the
heights of Pentelicus apparently to attract his attention; when he set
sail the next morning and, instead of turning eastwards, proceeded to
double Cape Sunion, Miltiades had no longer any doubt that treachery was
at work, and returned to Athens by forced marches. Datis, on entering
the roads of Phalerum, found the shore defended, and the army that he
had left at Marathon encamped upon the Cynosargê. He cruised about for
a few hours in sight of the shore, and finding no movement made to
encourage him to land, he turned his vessels about and set sail for
Ionia.

<p>
The material loss to the Persians was inconsiderable, for even the
Cyclades remained under their authority; Miltiades, who endeavoured
to retake them, met with a reverse before Paros, and the Athenians,
disappointed by his unsuccessful attempt, made no further efforts to
regain them. The moral effect of the victory on Greece and the empire
was extraordinary. Up till then the Median soldiers had been believed
to be the only invincible troops in the world; the sight of them
alone excited dread in the bravest hearts, and their name was received
everywhere with reverential awe. But now a handful of hoplites from one
of the towns of the continent, and that not the most renowned for its
prowess, without cavalry or bowmen, had rushed upon and overthrown the
most terrible of all Oriental battalions, the Persians and the Sakæ.
Darius could not put up with such an affront without incurring the risk
of losing his prestige with the people of Asia and Europe, who up till
then had believed him all-powerful, and of thus exposing himself to the
possibility of revolutions in recently subdued countries, such as Egypt,
which had always retained the memory of her past greatness. In the
interest of his own power, as well as to soothe his wounded pride, a
renewed attack was imperative, and this time it must be launched with
such dash and vigour that all resistance would be at once swept before
it. Events had shown him that the influence of the Pisistratidæ had not
been strong enough to secure for him the opening of the gates of Athens,
and that the sea route did not permit of his concentrating an adequate
force of cavalry and infantry on the field of battle; he therefore
reverted to the project of an expedition by the overland route, skirting
the coasts of Thrace and Macedonia. During three years he collected
arms, provisions, horses, men, and vessels, and was ready to commence
hostilities in the spring of 487, when affairs in Egypt prevented him.
This country had undeniably prospered under his suzerainty. It formed,
with Cyrene and the coast of Libya, the sixth of his satrapies, to which
were attached the neighbouring Nubian tribes of the southern frontier.*
The Persian satrap, installed at the White Wall in the ancient palace of
the Pharaohs, was supported by an army of 120,000 men, who occupied the
three entrenched camps of the Saites&mdash;Daphnæ and Marea on the confines
of the Delta, and Elephantinê in the south.** Outside these military
stations, where the authority of the great king was exercised in a
direct manner, the ancient feudal organisation existed intact. The
temples retained their possessions and their vassals, and the nobles
within their principalities were as independent and as inclined to
insurrection as in past times. The annual tribute, the heaviest paid by
any province with the exception of Cossæa and Assyria, amounted only
to 700 talents of silver. To this sum must be added the farming of the
fishing in Lake Moeris, which, according to Herodotus,*** brought in one
talent a day during the six months of the high Nile, but, according to
Diodorus,**** during the whole year, as well as the 120,000 medimni of
wheat required for the army of occupation, and the obligation to furnish
the court of Susa with Libyan nitre and Nile water; the total of these
impositions was far from constituting a burden disproportionate to the
wealth of the Nile valley.
</p>
<pre>
     * The Nubian tribes, who are called Ethiopians by Herodotus
     and the cuneiform inscriptions, paid no regular tribute, but
     were obliged to send annually two chænikes of pure gold, two
     hundred pieces of ebony, twenty elephants' tusks, and five
     young slaves, all under the name of a free gift.

     ** Herodotus states that in his own time the Persians, like
     the Saite Pharaohs, still had garrisons at Daphnæ and at
     Elephantine.

     *** Herodotus says that the produce sank to the value of a
     third of a talent a day during the six other months.

     **** Diodorus Siculus says that the revenue produced by the
     fisheries in the Lake had been handed over by Moris to his
     wife for the expenses of her toilet.
</pre>



<p>
Commerce brought in to it, in fact, at least as much money as the
tribute took out of it. Incorporated with an empire which extended over
three continents, Egypt had access to regions whither the products of
her industry and her soil had never yet been carried. The produce of
Ethiopia and the Sudan passed through her emporia on its way to attract
customers in the markets of Tyre, Sidon, Babylon, and Susa, and the
isthmus of Suez and Kosseir were the nearest ports through which Arabia
and India could reach the Mediterranean. Darius therefore resumed the
work of Necho, and beginning simultaneously at both extremities, he cut
afresh the canal between the Nile and the Gulf of Suez. Trilingual
stelæ in Egyptian, Persian, and Medic were placed at intervals along its
banks, and set forth to all comers the method of procedure by which the
sovereign had brought his work to a successful end. In a similar manner
he utilised the Wadys which wind between Koptos and the Red Sea, and
by their means placed the cities of the Said in communication with the
"Ladders of Incense," Punt and the Sabæans.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Several of the inscriptions engraved on the rocks of the
     Wady Hammamât show to what an extent the route was
     frequented at certain times during the reign. They bear the
     dates of the 26th, 27th, 28th, 30th, and 36th years of
     Darius. The country of Saba (Sheba) is mentioned on one of
     the stelæ of the isthmus.
</pre>
<p>
He extended his favour equally to the commerce which they carried on
with the interior of Africa; indeed, in order to ensure the safety of
the caravans in the desert regions nearest to the Nile, he skilfully
fortified the Great Oasis. He erected at Habît, Kushît, and other
places, several of those rectangular citadels with massive walls of
unburnt brick, which resisted every effort of the nomad tribes to break
through them; and as the temple at Habit, raised in former times by the
Theban Pharaohs, had become ruinous, he rebuilt it from its foundations.

He was generous in his gifts to the gods, and even towns as obscure as
Edfu was then received from him grants of money and lands. The Egyptians
at first were full of gratitude for the favours shown them, but the news
of the defeat at Marathon, and the taxes with which the Susian court
burdened them in order to make provision for the new war with Greece,
aroused a deep-seated discontent, at all events amongst those who,
living in the Delta, had had their patriotism or their interests most
affected by the downfall of the Saite dynasty. It would appear that the
priests of Buto, whose oracles exercised an indisputable influence alike
over Greeks and natives, had energetically incited the people to revolt.
The storm broke in 486, and a certain Khabbisha, who perhaps belonged
to the family of Psammetichus, proclaimed himself king both at Sais and
Memphis.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus does not give the name of the leader of the
     rebellion, but says that it took place in the fourth year
     after Marathon. A demotic contract in the Turin Museum bears
     the date of the third month of the second season of the
     thirty-fifth year of Darius I.: Khabbîsha's rebellion
     therefore broke out between June and September, 486. Stern
     makes this prince to have been of Libyan origin. From the
     form of his name, Révillout has supposed that he was an
     Arab, and Birch was inclined to think that he was a Persian
     satrap who made a similar attempt to that of Aryandes. But
     nothing is really known of him or of his family previous to
     his insurrection against Darius.

Darius did not believe the revolt to be of sufficient gravity to delay
his plans for any length of time. He hastily assembled a second
army, and was about to commence hostilities on the banks of the Nile
simultaneously with those on the Hellespont, when he died in 485, in the
thirty-sixth year of his reign. He was one of the great sovereigns of
the ancient world&mdash;the greatest without exception of those who had ruled
over Persia. Cyrus and Cambyses had been formidable warriors, and the
kingdoms of the Bast had fallen before their arms, but they were purely
military sovereigns, and if their successor had not possessed other
abilities than theirs, their empire would have shared the fate of that
of the Medes and the Chaldæans; it would have sunk to its former level
as rapidly as it had risen, and the splendour of its opening years
would have soon faded from remembrance. Darius was no less a general
by instinct and training than they, as is proved by the campaigns which
procured him his crown; but, after having conquered, he knew how to
organise and build up a solid fabric out of the materials which his
predecessors had left in a state of chaos; if Persia maintained her rule
over the East for two entire centuries, it was due to him and to him
alone. The question of the succession, with its almost inevitable
popular outbreaks, had at once to be dealt with. Darius had had several
wives, and among them, the daughter of Gobryas, who had borne him
three children: Artabazanes, the eldest, had long been regarded as the
heir-presumptive, and had probably filled the office of regent during
the expedition in Scythia. But Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, who had
already been queen under Cambyses and Gaumâta, was indignant at the
thought of her sons bowing down before the child of a woman who was not
of Achæmenian race, and at the moment when affairs in Egypt augured
ill for the future, and when the old king, according to custom, had
to appoint his successor, she intreated him to choose Khshayarsha, the
eldest of her children, who had been borne to the purple, and in whose
veins flowed the blood of Cyrus. Darius acceded to her request, and
on his death, a few months after, Khshayarsha ascended the throne. His
brothers offered no opposition, and the Persian nobles did homage to
their new king. Khshayarsha, whom the Greeks called Xerxes, was at that
time thirty-four years of age. He was tall, vigorous, of an imposing
figure and noble countenance, and he had the reputation of being the
handsomest man of his time, but neither his intelligence nor disposition
corresponded to his outward appearance; he was at once violent and
feeble, indolent, narrow-minded, and sensual, and was easily swayed by
his courtiers and mistresses. The idea of a war had no attractions for
him, and he was inclined to shirk it. His uncle Artabanus exhorted him
to follow his inclination for peace, and he lent a favourable ear to his
advice until his cousin Mardonius remonstrated with him, and begged him
not to leave the disgrace of Marathon unpunished, or he would lower the
respect attached to the name of Persia throughout the world. He wished,
at all events, to bring Egyptian affairs to an issue before involving
himself in a serious European war. Khabbîsha had done his best to
prepare a stormy reception for him. During a period of two years
Khabbîsha had worked at the extension of the entrenchments along the
coast and at the mouths of the Nile, in order to repulse the attack that
he foresaw would take place simultaneously with that on land, but his
precautions proved fruitless when the decisive moment arrived, and he
was completely crushed by the superior numbers of Xerxes.

<p>
The nomes of the Delta which had taken a foremost part in the rising
were ruthlessly raided, the priests heavily fined, and the oracle of
Buto deprived of its possessions as a punishment for the encouragement
freely given to the rebels. Khabbîsha disappeared, and his fate is
unknown. Achæmenes, one of the king's brothers, was made satrap, but,
as on previous occasions, the constitution of the country underwent
no modification. The temples retained their inherited domains, and the
nomes continued in the hands of their hereditary princes, without a
suspicion crossing the mind of Xerxes that his tolerance of the priestly
institutions and the local dynasties was responsible for the maintenance
of a body of chiefs ever in readiness for future insurrection (483).*

     * The only detailed information on this revolt furnished by
     the Egyptian monuments is given in the Stele of Ptolemy, the
     son of Lagos. An Apis, whose sarcophagus still exists, was
     buried by Khabbîsha in the Serapoum in the second year of
     his reign, which proves that he was in possession of
     Memphis: the White Wall had perhaps been deprived of its
     garrison in order to reinforce the army prepared against
     Greece, and it was possibly thus that it fell into the hands
     of Khabbîsha.
</pre>
<p>
Order was once more restored, but he was not yet entirely at liberty to
pursue his own plan of action. Classical tradition tells us, that on
the occasion of his first visit to Babylon he had offended the religious
prejudices of the Chaldæans by a sacrilegious curiosity. He had, in
spite of the entreaties of the priests, forced an entrance into the
ancient burial-place of Bel-Etana, and had beheld the body of the old
hero preserved in oil in a glass sarcophagus, which, however, was not
quite full of the liquid. A notice posted up beside it, threatened the
king who should violate the secret of the tomb with a cruel fate, unless
he filled the sarcophagus to the brim, and Xerxes had attempted to
accomplish this mysterious injunction, but all his efforts had failed.
The example set by Egypt and the change of sovereign are sufficient to
account for the behaviour of the Babylonians; they believed that the
accession of a comparatively young monarch, and the difficulties of the
campaign on the banks of the Nile, afforded them a favourable occasion
for throwing off the yoke. They elected as king a certain Shamasherib,
whose antecedents are unknown; but their independence was of short
duration,* for Megabyzos, son of Zopyrus, who governed the province by
hereditary right, forced them to disarm after a siege of a few months.
</p>
<pre>
     * This Shamasherib is mentioned only on a contract dated
     from his accession, which is preserved in the British
     Museum.
</pre>
<p>
It would appear that Xerxes treated them with the greatest severity: he
pillaged the treasury and temple of Bel, appropriated the golden statue
which decorated the great inner hall of the ziggurât, and carried away
many of the people into captivity (581). Babylon never recovered this
final blow: the quarters of the town that had been pillaged remained
uninhabited and fell into ruins; commerce dwindled and industry flagged.
The counsellors of Xerxes had, no doubt, wished to give an object-lesson
to the province by their treatment of Babylon, and thus prevent the
possibility of a revolution taking place in Asia while its ruler was
fully engaged in a struggle with the Greeks. Meanwhile all preparations
were completed, and the contingents of the eastern and southern
provinces concentrated at Kritalla, in Cappadocia, merely awaited the
signal to set out. Xerxes gave the order to advance in the autumn of
481, crossed the Halys and took up his quarters at Sardes, while his
fleet prepared to winter in the neighbouring ports of Phocæ and Kymê.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Diodorus, who probably follows Ephorus, is the only writer
     who informs us of the place where the fleet was assembled.
</pre>
<p>
Gathered together in that little corner of the world, were forces such
as no king had ever before united under his command; they comprised 1200
vessels of various build, and probably 120,000 combatants, besides the
rabble of servants, hucksters, and women which followed all the armies
of that period. The Greeks exaggerated the number of the force beyond
all probability. They estimated it variously at 800,000, at 3,000,000,
and at 5,283,220 men; 1,700,000 of whom were able-bodied foot-soldiers,
and 80,000 of them horsemen.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus records the epigram to the effect that 3,000,000
     men attacked Thermopylæ. Ctesias and Ephorus adopt the same
     figures; Iso-crates is contented with 700,000 combatants and
     5,000,000 men in all.

</pre>
<p>
The troops which they could bring up to oppose these hordes were,
indeed, so slender in number, when reckoned severally, that all hope
of success seemed impossible. Xerxes once more summoned the Greeks to
submit, and most of the republics appeared inclined to comply; Athens
and Sparta alone refused, but from different motives. Athens knew that,
after the burning of Sardes and the victory of Marathon, they could hope
for no pity, and she was well aware that Persia had decreed her complete
destruction; the Athenians were familiar with the idea of a struggle in
which their very existence was at stake, and they counted on the navy
with which Themistocles had just provided them to enable them to emerge
from the affair with honour. Sparta was not threatened with the same
fate, but she was at that time the first military state in Greece, and
the whole of the Peloponnesus acknowledged her sway; in the event of her
recognising the suzerainty of the barbarians, the latter would not fail
to require of her the renunciation of her hegemony, and she would then
be reduced to the same rank as her former rivals, Tegea and Argos.
Athens and Sparta therefore united to repulse the common enemy, and the
advantage that this alliance afforded them was so patent that none of
the other states ventured to declare openly for the great king. Argos
and Crete, the boldest of them, announced that they would observe
neutrality; the remainder, Thessalians, Boeotians, and people
of Corcyra, gave their support to the national cause, but did so
unwillingly.
</p>
<p>
Xerxes crossed the Hellespont in the spring of 480, by two bridges of
boats thrown across it between Abydos and Sestos; he then formed his
force into three columns, and made his way slowly along the coast,
protected on the left by the whole of his fleet from any possible attack
by the squadrons of the enemy. The Greeks had three lines of defence
which they could hold against him, the natural strength of which nearly
compensated them for the inferiority of their forces; these were Mount
Olympus, Mount OEta, and the isthmus of Corinth. The first, however, was
untenable, owing to the ill will of the Thessalians; as a precautionary
measure 10,000 hoplites were encamped upon it, but they evacuated the
position as soon as the enemy's advance-guard came into sight. The
natural barrier of OEta, less formidable than that of Olympus, was
flanked by the Euboean straits on the extreme right, but the range
was of such extent that it did not require to be guarded with equal
vigilance along its whole length. The Spartans did not at first occupy
it, for they intended to accumulate all the Greek forces, both troops
and vessels, around the isthmus. At that point the neck of land was so
narrow, and the sea so shut in, that the numbers of the invading force
proved a drawback to them, and the advantage almost of necessity lay
with that of the two adversaries who should be best armed and best
officered. This plan of the Spartans was a wise one, but Athens, which
was thereby sacrificed to the general good, refused to adopt it, and
as she alone furnished almost half the total number of vessels, her
decision had to be deferred to. A body of about 10,000 hoplites
was therefore posted in the pass of Thermopylæ under the command of
Leonidas, while a squadron of 271 vessels disposed themselves near the
promontory of Artemision, off the Euripus, and protected the right flank
of the pass against a diversion from the fleet. Meanwhile Xerxes had
been reinforced in the course of his march by the contingents from
Macedonia, and had received the homage of the cities of Thessaly; having
reached the defiles of the OEta and the Euboea, he began by attacking
the Creeks directly in front, both fleets and armies facing one another.
Leonidas succeeded in withstanding the assault on two successive days,
and then the inevitable took place. A detachment of Persians, guided
by the natives of the country, emerged by a path which had been left
unguarded, and bore down upon the Greeks in the rear; a certain number
managed to escape, but the bulk of the force, along with the 300
Spartans and their king, succumbed after a desperate resistance. As for
the fleet, it had borne itself bravely, and had retained the ascendency
throughout, in spite of the superiority of the enemy's numbers; on
hearing the news of the glorious death of Leonidas, they believed their
task ended for the time being, and retired with the Athenians in their
wake, ready to sustain the attack should they come again to close
quarters. The victorious side had suffered considerable losses in men
and vessels, but they had forced the passage, and Central Greece now
lay at their mercy. Xerxes received the submission of the Thebans, the
Phocæans, the Locrians, the Dorians, and of all who appealed to his
clemency; then, having razed to the ground Platæa and Thespisæ, the only
two towns which refused to come to terms with him, he penetrated into
Attica by the gorges of the Cithssron. The population had taken refuge
in Salamis, Ægina, and Troezen. The few fanatics who refused to desist
in their defence of the Acropolis, soon perished behind their ramparts;
Xerxes destroyed the temple of Pallas by fire to avenge the burning of
Sardes, and then entrenched his troops on the approaches to the isthmus,
stationing his squadrons in the ports of Munychia, Phalerum, and the
Piræus, and suspended all hostilities while waiting to see what policy
the Greeks would pursue. It is possible that he hoped that a certain
number of them would intreat for mercy, and others being encouraged
by their example to submit, no further serious battle would have to be
fought. When he found that no such request was proffered, he determined
to take advantage of the superiority of his numbers, and, if possible,
destroy at one blow the whole of the Greek naval reserve; he therefore
gave orders to his admirals to assume the offensive. The Greek fleet lay
at anchor across the bay of Salamis. The left squadron of the Persians,
leaving Munychia in the middle of the night, made for the promontory of
Cynosura, landing some troops as it passed on the island of Psyttalia,
on which it was proposed to fall back in case of accident, while
the right division, sailing close to the coast of Attica, closed
the entrance to the straits in the direction of Eleusis; this double
movement was all but completed, when the Greeks were informed by
fugitives of what was taking place, and the engagement was inevitable.
They accepted it fearlessly. Xerxes, enthroned with his Immortals on the
slopes of Ægialeos, could, from his exalted position, see the Athenians
attack his left squadron: the rest of the allies followed them, and
from afar these words were borne upon the breeze: "Go, sons of Greece,
deliver your country, deliver your children, your wives, and the temples
of the gods of your fathers and the tombs of your ancestors. A single
battle will decide the fate of all you possess." The Persians fought
with their accustomed bravery, "but before long their numberless
vessels, packed closely together in a restricted space, begin to hamper
each other's movements, and their rams of brass collide; whole rows of
oars are broken." The Greek vessels, lighter and easier to manoeuvre
than those of the Phoenicians, surround the latter and disable them in
detail. "The surface of the sea is hidden with floating wreckage and
corpses; the shore and the rocks are covered with the dead." At length,
towards evening, the energy of the barbarians beginning to flag, they
slowly fell back upon the Piræus, closely followed by their adversaries,
while Aristides bore down upon Psyttalia with a handful of Athenians.
"Like tunnies, like fish just caught in a net, with blows from broken
oars, with fragments of spars, they fall upon the Persians, they tear
them to pieces. The sea resounds from afar with groans and cries of
lamentation. Night at length unveils her sombre face" and separates the
combatants.*

     battle, and the one which Herodotus and all the historians
     after him have paraphrased, while they also added to it oral
     traditions.
</pre>

<p>
The advantage lay that day with the Greeks, but hostilities might
be resumed on the morrow, and the resources of the Persians were so
considerable that their chances of victory were not yet exhausted.
Xerxes at first showed signs of wishing to continue the struggle; he
repaired the injured vessels and ordered a dyke to be constructed,
which, by uniting Salamis to the mainland, would enable him to oust the
Athenians from their last retreat. But he had never exhibited much zest
for the war; the inevitable fatigues and dangers of a campaign were
irksome to his indolent nature, and winter was approaching, which he
would be obliged to spend far from Susa, in the midst of a country
wasted and trampled underfoot by two great armies. Mardonius, guessing
what was passing in his sovereign's mind, advised him to take advantage
of the fine autumn weather to return to Sardes; he proposed to take over
from Xerxes the command of the army in Greece, and to set to work to
complete the conquest of the Peloponnesus. He was probably glad to
be rid of a sovereign whose luxurious habits were a hindrance to his
movements. Xerxes accepted his proposal with evident satisfaction,
and summarily despatching his vessels to the Hellespont to guard the
bridges, he set out on his return journey by the overland route.
</p>
<p>
At the time of his departure the issue of the struggle was as yet
unforeseen. Mardonius evacuated Attica, which was too poor and desolate
a country to support so large an army, and occupied comfortable winter
quarters in the rich plains of Thessaly, where he recruited his strength
for a supreme effort in the spring. He had with him about 60,000 men,
picked troops from all parts of Asia&mdash;Medes, Sakæ, Bactrians, and
Indians, besides the regiment of the Immortals and the Egyptian veterans
who had distinguished themselves by their bravery at Salamis; the heavy
hoplites of Thebes and of the Boeotian towns, the Thessalian cavalry,
and the battalions of Macedonia were also in readiness to join him as
soon as called on. The whole of these troops, relieved from the presence
of the useless multitude which had impeded its movements under Xerxes,
and commanded by a bold and active general, were anxious to distinguish
themselves, and the probabilities of their final success were great. The
confederates were aware of the fact, and although resolved to persevere
to the end, their maoeuvres betrayed an unfortunate indecision. Their
fleet followed the Persian squadron bound for the Hellespont for several
days, but on realising that the enemy were not planning a diversion
against the Peloponnesus, they put about and returned to their various
ports. The winter was passed in preparations on both sides. Xerxes, on
his return to Sardes, had got together a fleet of 200 triremes and an
army of 60,000 men, and had stationed them at Cape Mycale, opposite
Samos, to be ready in case of an Ionian revolt, or perhaps to bear down
upon any given point in the Peloponnesus when Mardonius had gained
some initial advantage. The Lacædemonians, on their part, seem to have
endeavoured to assume the defensive both by land and sea; while their
foot-soldiers were assembling in the neighbourhood of Corinth, their
fleet sailed as far as Delos and there anchored, as reluctant to venture
beyond as if it had been a question of proceeding to the Pillars of
Hercules. Athens, which ran the risk of falling into the enemy's hands
for the second time through these hesitations, evinced such marked
displeasure that Mardonius momentarily attempted to take advantage of
it. He submitted to the citizens, through Alexander, King of Macedon,
certain conditions, the leniency of which gave uneasiness to the
Spartans; the latter at once promised Athens all she wanted, and on the
strength of their oaths she at once broke off the negotiations with the
Persians. Mardonius immediately resolved on action: he left his quarters
in Thessaly in the early days of May, reached Attica by a few
quick marches, and spread his troops over the country before the
Peloponnesians were prepared to resist. The people again took refuge in
Salamis; the Persians occupied Athens afresh, and once more had recourse
to diplomacy. This time the Spartans were alarmed to good purpose; they
set out to the help of their ally, and from that moment Mardonius showed
no further consideration in his dealing with Athens. He devastated the
surrounding country, razed the city walls to the ground, and demolished
and burnt the remaining houses and temples; he then returned to Boeotia,
the plains of which were more suited to the movements of his squadrons,
and took up a position in an entrenched camp on the right bank of the
Asopos. The Greek army, under the command of Pausanias, King of Sparta,
subsequently followed him there, and at first stationed themselves on
the lower slopes of Mount Cithseron. Their force was composed of about
25,000 hoplites, and about as many more light troops, and was scarcely
inferior in numbers to the enemy, but it had no cavalry of any kind.
Several days passed in skirmishing without definite results, Mardonius
fearing to let his Asiatic troops attack the heights held by the heavy
Greek infantry, and Pausanias alarmed lest his men should be crushed by
the Thessalian and Persian horse if he ventured down into the plains.
Want of water at length obliged the Greeks to move slightly westwards,
their right wing descending as far as the spring of Gargaphia, and their
left to the bank of the Asopos. But this position facing east, exposed
them so seriously to the attacks of the light Asiatic horse, that after
enduring it for ten days they raised their camp and fell back in the
night on Platæa. Unaccustomed to manouvre together, they were unable
to preserve their distances; when day dawned, their lines, instead
of presenting a continuous front, were distributed into three unequal
bodies occupying various parts of the plain. Mardonius unhesitatingly
seized his opportunity. He crossed the Asopos, ordered the Thebans to
attack the Athenians, and with the bulk of his Asiatic troops charged
the Spartan contingents. Here, as at Marathon, the superiority of
equipment soon gave the Greeks the advantage: Mardonius was killed while
leading the charge of the Persian guard, and, as is almost always the
case among Orientals, his death decided the issue of the battle. The
Immortals were cut to pieces round his dead body, while the rest took
flight and sought refuge in their camp.

<p>
Almost simultaneously the Athenians succeeded in routing the Boeotians.
They took the entrenchments by assault, gained possession of an immense
quantity of spoil, and massacred many of the defenders, but they could
not prevent Artabazus from retiring in perfect order with 40,000 of
his best troops protected by his cavalry. He retired successively from
Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace, reached Asia after suffering severe
losses, and European Greece was freed for ever from the presence of the
barbarians. While her fate was being decided at Platsæ, that of Asiatic
Greece was being fought out on the coast of Ionia. The entreaties of the
Samians had at length encouraged Leotychidas and Xanthippus to take the
initiative. The Persian generals, who were not expecting this aggressive
movement, had distributed the greater part of their vessels throughout
the Ionian ports, and had merely a small squadron left at their disposal
at Mycale. Surprised by the unexpected appearance of the enemy, they
were compelled to land, were routed, and their vessels burnt (479). This
constituted the signal for a general revolt: Samos, Chios, and Lesbos
affiliated themselves to the Hellenic confederation, and the cities of
the littoral, which Sparta would have been powerless to protect for want
of a fleet, concluded an alliance with Athens, whose naval superiority
had been demonstrated by recent events. The towns of the Hellespont
threw off the yoke as soon as the triremes of the confederates appeared
within their waters, and Sestos, the only one of them prevented by its
Persian garrison from yielding to the Athenians, succumbed, after a long
siege, during the winter of 479-478. The campaign of 478 completed the
deliverance of the Greeks. A squadron commanded by Pausanias roused the
islands of the Carian coast and Cyprus itself, without encountering
any opposition, and then steering northwards drove the Persians from
Byzantium. The following winter the conduct of operations passed out of
the hands of Sparta into those of Athens&mdash;from the greatest military to
the greatest naval power in Greece; and the latter, on assuming command,
at once took steps to procure the means which would enable her to carry,
out her task thoroughly. She brought about the formation of a permanent
league between the Asiatic Greeks and those of the islands. Each city
joining it preserved a complete autonomy as far as its internal affairs
were concerned, but pledged itself to abide by the advice of Athens
in everything connected with the war against the Persian empire, and
contributed a certain quota of vessels, men, and money, calculated
according to its resources, for the furtherance of the national cause.
The centre of the confederation was fixed at Delos; the treasure held
in common was there deposited under the guardianship of the god, and the
delegates from the confederate states met there every year at the solemn
festivals, Athens to audit the accounts of her administration, and
the allies to discuss the interests of the league and to decide on the
measures to be taken against the common enemy.
</p>
<p>
Oriental empires maintain their existence only on condition of being
always on the alert and always victorious. They can neither restrict
themselves within definite limits nor remain upon the defensive, for
from the day when they desist from extending their area their ruin
becomes inevitable; they must maintain their career of conquest, or they
must cease to exist. This very activity which saves them from downfall
depends, like the control of affairs, entirely on the ruling sovereign;
when he chances to be too indolent or too incapable of government, he
retards progress by his inertness or misdirects it through his want of
skill, and the fate of the people is made thus to depend entirely on the
natural disposition of the prince, since none of his subjects possesses
sufficient authority to correct the mistakes of his master. Having
conquered Asia, the Persian race, finding itself hemmed in by
insurmountable obstacles&mdash;the sea, the African and Arabian deserts, the
mountains of Turkestan and the Caucasus, and the steppes of Siberia&mdash;had
only two outlets for its energy, Greece and India. Darius had led
his army against the Greeks, and, in spite of the resistance he had
encountered from them, he had gained ground, and was on the point of
striking a crucial blow, when death cut short his career. The impetus
that he had given to the militant policy was so great that Xerxes was
at first carried away by it; but he was naturally averse to war, without
individual energy and destitute of military genius, so that he allowed
himself to be beaten where, had he possessed anything of the instincts
of a commander, he would have been able to crush his adversary with the
sheer weight of his ships and battalions. Even after Salamis, even after
Platæa and Mycale, the resources of Hellas, split up as it was into
fifty different republics, could hardly bear comparison with those
of all Asia concentrated in the hands of one man: Xerxes must have
triumphed in the end had he persevered in his undertaking, and utilised
the inexhaustible amount of fresh material with which his empire could
have furnished him. But to do that he would have had to take a serious
view of his duties as a sovereign, as Cyrus and Darius had done, whereas
he appears to have made use of his power merely for the satisfaction of
his luxurious tastes and his capricious affections. During the winter
following his return, and while he was reposing at Sardes after the
fatigues of his campaign in Greece, he fell in love with the wife of
Masistes, one of his brothers, and as she refused to entertain his suit,
he endeavoured to win her by marrying his son Darius to her daughter
Artayntas. He was still amusing himself with this ignoble intrigue
during the year which witnessed the disasters of Platæa and Mycale, when
he was vaguely entertaining the idea of personally conducting a fresh
army beyond the Ægean: but the marriage of his son having taken place,
he returned to Susa in the autumn, accompanied by the entire court, and
from thenceforward he remained shut up in the heart of his empire. After
his departure the war lost its general character, and deteriorated into
a series of local skirmishes between the satraps in the vicinity of the
Mediterranean and the members of the league of Delos. The Phoenician
fleet played the principal part in the naval operations, but the
central and eastern Asiatics&mdash;Bactrians, Indians, Parthians, Arians,
Arachosians, Armenians, and the people from Susa and Babylon&mdash;scarcely
took any part in the struggle. The Athenians at the outset assumed the
offensive under the intelligent direction of Cimon. They expelled the
Persian garrisons from Eion and Thrace in 476. They placed successively
under their own hegemony all the Greek communities of the Asianic
littoral. Towards 466, they destroyed a fleet anchored within the Gulf
of Pamphylia, close to the mouth of the Eurymedon, and, as at Mycale,
they landed and dispersed the force destined to act in concert with
the squadron. Sailing from thence to Cyprus, they destroyed a second
Phoenician fleet of eighty vessels, and returned to the Piraeus laden
with booty. Such exploits were not devoid of glory and profit for
the time being, but they had no permanent results. All these naval
expeditions were indeed successful, and the islands and towns of the
Ægean, and even those of the Black Sea and the southern coasts of Asia
Minor, succeeded without difficulty in freeing themselves from the
Persian yoke under the protection of the Athenian triremes; but their
influence did not penetrate further inland than a few miles from the
shore, beyond which distance they ran the risk of being cut off from
their vessels, and the barbarians of the interior&mdash;Lydians, Phrygians,
Mysians, Pamphylians, and even most of the Lycians and Carians&mdash;remained
subject to the rule of the satraps. The territory thus liberated formed
but a narrow border along the coast of the peninsula; a border rent and
interrupted at intervals, constantly in peril of seizure by the enemy,
and demanding considerable efforts every year for its defence. Athens
was in danger of exhausting her resources in the performance of this
ungrateful task, unless she could succeed in fomenting some revolution
in the vast possessions of her adversary which should endanger the
existence of his empire, or which, at any rate, should occupy the
Persian soldiery in constantly recurring hostilities against the
rebellious provinces. If none of the countries in the centre of Asia
Minor would respond to their call, and if the interests of their
commercial rivals, the Phoenicians, were so far opposed to their own as
to compel them to maintain the conflict to the very end, Egypt, at any
rate, always proud of her past glory and impatient of servitude,
was ever seeking to rid herself of the foreign yoke and recover her
independent existence under, the authority of her Pharaohs. It was not
easy to come to terms with her and give her efficient help from Athens
itself; but Cyprus, with its semi-Greek population hostile to the
Achæmenids, could, if they were to take possession of it, form an
admirable base of operations in that corner of the Mediterranean. The
Athenians were aware of this from the outset, and, after their victory
at the mouth of the Eurymedon, a year never elapsed without their
despatching a more or less numerous fleet into Cypriot waters; by so
doing they protected the Ægean from the piracy of the Phoenicians, and
at the same time, in the event of any movement arising on the banks of
the Nile, they were close enough to the Delta to be promptly informed
of it, and to interfere to their own advantage before any repressive
measures could be taken.

<p>
The field of hostilities having shifted, and Greece having now set
herself to attempt the dismemberment of the Persian empire, we may well
ask what has become of Xerxes. The little energy and intelligence he
had possessed at the outset were absorbed by a life of luxury and
debauchery. Weary of his hopeless pursuit of the wife of Masistes,
he transferred his attentions to the Artayntas whom he had given in
marriage to his son Darius, and succeeded in seducing her. The vanity
of this unfortunate woman at length excited the jealously of the queen.
Amestris believed herself threatened by the ascendency of this mistress;
she therefore sent for the girl's mother, whom she believed guilty of
instigating the intrigue, and, having cut off her breasts, ears, nose,
lips, and torn out her tongue, she sent her back, thus mutilated, to her
family. Masistes, wishing to avenge her, set out for Bactriana, of which
district he was satrap: he could easily have incited the province to
rebel, for its losses in troops during the wars in Europe had been
severe, and a secret discontent was widespread; but Xerxes, warned in
time, despatched horsemen in pursuit, who overtook and killed him. The
incapacity of the king, and the slackness with which he held the reins
of government', were soon so apparent as to produce intrigues at court:
Artabanus, the chief captain of the guards, was emboldened by the
state of affairs to attempt to substitute his own rule for that of
the Achæmenids, and one night he assassinated Xerxes. His method of
procedure was never exactly known, and several accounts of it were soon
afterwards current. One of them related that he had as his accomplice
the eunuch Aspamithres. Having committed the crime, both of them rushed
to the chamber of Artaxerxes,* one of the sons of the sovereign, but
still a child; they accused Darius, the heir to the throne, of the
murder, and having obtained an order to seize him, they dragged him
before his brother and stabbed him, while he loudly protested his
innocence.
</p>
<pre>
     * Artaxerxes is the form commonly adopted by the Greek
     historians and by the moderns who follow them, but Ctcsias
     and others after him prefer Artoxerxes. The original form of
     the Persian name was Artakhshathra.
</pre>



<p>
Other tales related that Artabanus had taken advantage of the free
access to the palace which his position allowed him, to conceal himself
one night within it, in company with his seven sons. Having murdered
Xerxes, he convinced Artaxerxes of the guilt of his brother, and
conducting him to the latter's chamber, where he was found asleep,
Artabanus stabbed him on the spot, on the pretence that he was only
feigning slumber.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Of the two principal accounts, the first is as old as
     Ctesias, who was followed in general outline by Ephorus, of
     whose account Diodorus Siculus preserves a summary
     compilation; the second was circulated by Dinon, and has
     come down to us through the abbreviation of Pompeius Trogus.
     The remains of a third account are met with in Aristotle.
     Ælian knew a fourth in which the murder was ascribed to the
     son of Xerxes himself.
</pre>
<p>
The murderer at first became the virtual sovereign, and he exercised his
authority so openly that later chronographers inserted his name in the
list of the Achæmenids, between that of his victim and his <i>protégé</i>;
but at the end of six months, when he was planning the murder of the
young prince, he was betrayed by Megabyzos and slain, together with his
accomplices. His sons, fearing a similar fate, escaped into the country
with some of the troops. They perished in a skirmish, sword in hand; but
their prompt defeat, though it helped to establish the new king upon his
throne, did not ensure peace, for the most turbulent provinces at the
two extremes of the empire, Bactriana on the northeast and Egypt in the
south-west, at once rose in arms. The Bactrians were led by Hystaspes,
one of the sons of Xerxes, who, being older than Artaxerxes, claimed
the throne; his pretensions were not supported by the neighbouring
provinces, and two bloody battles soon sealed his fate (462).* The
chastisement of Egypt proved a harder task. Since the downfall of the
Saites, the eastern nomes of the Delta had always constituted a single
fief, which the Greeks called the kingdom of Libya. Lords of Marea and
of the fertile districts extending between the Canopic arm of the Nile,
the mountains, and the sea, its princes probably exercised suzerainty
over several of the Libyan tribes of Marmarica. Inaros, son of
Psammetichus,** who was then the ruling sovereign, defied the Persians
openly. The inhabitants of the Delta, oppressed by the tax-gatherers of
Achæmenes,*** welcomed him with open arms, and he took possession of
the country between the two branches of the Nile, probably aided by the
Cyrenians; the Nile valley itself and Memphis, closely guarded by the
Persian garrisons, did not, however, range themselves on his side.
</p>
<pre>
     * The date 462 is approximate, and is inferred from the fact
     that the war in Bactriana is mentioned in Ctesias between
     the war against the sons of Artabanus which must have
     occupied a part of 463, and the Egyptian rebellion which
     broke out about 462, as Diodorus Siculus points out,
     doubtless following Ephorus.

     ** The name of the father of Inaros is given us by the
     contemporary testimony of Thucydides.

     *** Achomenes is the form given by Herodotus and by Diodorus
     Siculus, who make him the son of Darius I., appointed
     governor of Egypt after the repression of the revolt of
     Khabbîsha. Ctesias calls him Achæmenides, and says that he
     was the son of Xerxes.
</pre>
<p>
Meanwhile the satrap, fearing that the troops at his disposal were
insufficient, had gone to beg assistance of his nephew. Artaxerxes had
assembled an army and a fleet, and, in the first moment of enthusiasm,
had intended to assume the command in person; but, by the advice of his
counsellors, he was with little difficulty dissuaded from carrying this
whim into effect, and he delegated the conduct of affairs to Achæmenes.
The latter at first repulsed the Libyans (460), and would probably
have soon driven them back into their deserts, had not the Athenians
interfered in the fray. They gave orders to their fleet at Cyprus
to support the insurgents by every means in their power, and their
appearance on the scene about the autumn of 469 changed the course
of affairs. Achæmenes was overcome at Papremis, and his army almost
completely exterminated. Inaros struck him down with his own hand in the
struggle; but the same evening he caused the body to be recovered, and
sent it to the court of Susa, though whether out of bravado, or from
respect to the Achæmenian race, it is impossible to say.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Diodorus Siculus says in so many words that the Athenians
     took part in the battle of Papremis; Thucydides and
     Herodotus do not speak of their being there, and several
     modern historians take this silence as a proof that their
     squadron arrived after the battle had been fought.
</pre>
<p>
His good fortune did not yet forsake him. Some days afterwards, the
Athenian squadron of Charitimides came up by chance with the Phoenician
fleet, which was sailing to the help of the Persians, and had not yet
received the news of the disaster which had befallen them at Papremis.
The Greeks sunk thirty of the enemy's vessels and took twenty more, and,
after this success, the allies believed that they had merely to show
themselves to bring about a general rising of the fellahîn, and effect
the expulsion of the Persians from the whole of Egypt. They sailed up
the river and forced Memphis after a few days' siege; but the garrison
of the White Wall refused to surrender, and the allies were obliged to
lay siege to it in the ordinary manner (459):* in the issue this proved
their ruin. Artaxerxes raised a fresh force in Cilicia, and while
completing his preparations, attempted to bring about a diversion in
Greece. The strength of Pharaoh did not so much depend on his Libyan and
Egyptian hordes, as on the little body of hoplites and the crews of
the Athenian squadron; and if the withdrawal of the latter could be
effected, the repulse of the others would be a certainty. Persian agents
were therefore employed to beg the Spartans to invade Attica; but the
remembrance of Salamis and Platæa was as yet too fresh to permit of the
Lacedæmonians allying themselves with the common enemy, and their virtue
on this occasion was proof against the darics of the Orientals.** The
Egyptian army was placed in the field early in the year 456, under the
leadership of Megabyzos, the satrap of Syria: it numbered, so it was
said, some 300,000 men, and it was supported by 300 Phoenician vessels
commanded by Artabazos.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The date of 459-8 for the arrival of the Athenians is
     concluded from the passage of Thucydides, who gives an
     account of the end of the war after the cruise of Tolmides
     in 455, in the sixth year of its course.

     ** Megabyzos opened these negotiations, and his presence at
     Sparta during the winter of 457-6 is noticed.

     *** Ctesias here introduces the Persian admiral Horiscos,
     but Diodorus places Artabazos and Megabyzos side by side, as
     was the case later on in the war in Cyprus, one at the head
     of the fleet, the other of the army; it is probable that the
     historian from whom Diodorus copied, viz. Ephorus,
     recognised the same division of leadership in the Egyptian
     campaign.
</pre>
<p>
The allies raised the blockade of the White Wall as soon as he
entered the Delta, and hastened to attack him; but they had lost their
opportunity. Defeated in a desperate encounter, in which Charitimides
was killed and Inaros wounded in the thigh, they barricaded themselves
within the large island of Prosopitis, about the first fortnight in
January of the year 455, and there sustained a regular siege for the
space of eighteen months. At the end of that time Megabyzos succeeded in
turning an arm of the river, which left their fleet high and dry, and,
rather than allow it to fall into his hands, they burned their vessels,
whereupon he gave orders to make the final assault. The bulk of the
Athenian auxiliaries perished in that day's attack, the remainder
withdrew with Inaros into the fortified town of Byblos, where Megabyzos,
unwilling to prolong a struggle with a desperate enemy, permitted them
to capitulate on honourable terms. Some of them escaped and returned to
Cyrene, from whence they took ship to their own country; but the main
body, to the number of 6000, were carried away to Susa by Megabyzos in
order to receive the confirmation of the treaty which he had concluded.
As a crowning stroke of misfortune, a reinforcement of fifty Athenian
triremes, which at this juncture entered the Mendesian mouth of the
Nile, was surrounded by the Phoenician fleet, and more than half of them
destroyed. The fall of Prosopitis brought the rebellion to an end.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The accounts of these events given by Ctesias and
     Thucydides are complementary, and, in spite of their
     brevity, together form a whole which must be sufficiently
     near the truth. That of Ephorus, preserved in Diodorus, is
     derived from an author who shows partiality to the
     Athenians, and who passes by everything not to their honour,
     while he seeks to throw the blame for the final disaster on
     the cowardice of the Egyptians. The summary of Aristodemus
     comes directly from that of Thucydides.
</pre>
<p>
The nomes of the Delta were restored to order, and, as was often
customary in Oriental kingdoms, the vanquished petty princes or their
children were reinvested in their hereditary fiefs; even Libya was not
taken from the family of Inaros, but was given to his son Thannyras and
a certain Psammetichus. A few bands of fugitives, however, took refuge
in the marshes of the littoral, in the place where the Saites in former
times had sought a safe retreat, and they there proclaimed king a
certain Amyrtgeus, who was possibly connected with the line of Amasis,
and successfully defied the repeated attempts of the Persians to
dislodge them.
</p>
<p>
The Greek league had risked the best of its forces in this rash
undertaking, and had failed in its enterprise. It had cost the allies so
dearly in men and galleys, that if the Persians had at once assumed the
offensive, most of the Asiatic cities would have found themselves in a
most critical situation; and Athens, then launched in a quarrel with
the states of the Peloponnesus, would have experienced the greatest
difficulty in succouring them. The feebleness of Artaxerxes, however,
and possibly the intrigues at court and troubles in various other parts
of the empire, prevented the satraps from pursuing their advantage, and
when at length they meditated taking action, the opportunity had gone
by. They nevertheless attempted to regain the ascendency over Cyprus;
Artabazos with a Sidonian fleet cruised about the island, Megabyzos
assembled troops in Cilicia, and the petty kings of Greek origin raised
a cry of alarm. Athens, which had just concluded a truce with the
Peloponnesians, at once sent two hundred vessels to their assistance
under the command of Oimon (449). Cimon acted as though he were about
to reopen the campaign in Egypt and despatched sixty of his triremes to
King Amyrtceus, while he himself took Marion and blockaded Kition with
the rest of his forces. The siege dragged on; he was perhaps about to
abandon it, when he took to his bed and died. Those who succeeded him in
the command were obliged to raise the blockade for want of provisions,
but as they returned and were passing Salamis, they fell in with the
Phoenician vessels which had just been landing the Cilician troops, and
defeated them; they then disembarked, and, as at Mycale and Eurymedon,
they gained a second victory in the open field, after which they joined
the squadron which had been sent to Egypt, and sailed for Athens with
the dead body of their chief. They had once more averted the danger of
an attack on the Ægean, but that was all. The Athenian statesmen had
for some time past realised that it was impossible for them to sustain
a double conflict, and fight the battles of Greece against the common
enemy, while half of the cities whose safety was secured by their heroic
devotion were harassing them on the continent, but the influence of
Cimon had up till now encouraged them to persist; on the death of Cimon,
they gave up the attempt, and Callias, one of their leaders, repaired in
state to Susa for the purpose of opening negotiations. The peace which
was concluded on the occasion of this embassy might at first sight
appear advantageous to their side. The Persian king, without actually
admitting his reverses, accepted their immediate consequences. He
recognised the independence of the Asiatic Creeks, of those at least who
belonged to the league of Delos, and he promised that his armies on
land should never advance further than three days' march from the Ægean
littoral. On the seas, he forbade his squadrons to enter Hellenic waters
from the Chelidonian to the Cyanæan rocks&mdash;that is, from the eastern
point of Lycia to the opening of the Black Sea: this prohibition did
not apply to the merchant vessels of the contracting parties, and
they received permission to traffic freely in each other's waters&mdash;the
Phoenicians in Greece, and the Greeks in Phonicia, Cilicia, and Egypt.
And yet, when we consider the matter, Athens and Hellas were, of the
two, the greater losers by this convention, which appeared to imply
their superiority. Not only did they acknowledge indirectly that they
felt themselves unequal to the task of overthrowing the empire, but
they laid down their arms before they had accomplished the comparatively
restricted task which they had set themselves to perform, that of
freeing all the Greeks from the Iranian yoke: their Egyptian compatriots
still remained Persian tributaries, in company with the cities of
Cyrenaïca, Pamphylia, and Cilicia, and, above all, that island of
Cyprus in which they had gained some of their most signal triumphs.
The Persians, relieved from a war which for a quarter of a century had
consumed their battalions and squadrons, drained their finances, and
excited their subjects to revolt, were now free to regain their former
wealth and perhaps their vigour, could they only find generals to
command their troops and guide their politics. Artaxerxes was incapable
of directing this revival, and his inveterate weakness exposed him
perpetually to the plotting of his satraps or to the intrigues of
the women of his harem. The example of Artabanus, followed by that of
Hystaspes, had shown how easy it was for an ambitious man to get rid
secretly of a monarch or a prince and seriously endanger the crown. The
members of the families who had placed Darius on the throne, possessed
by hereditary right, or something little short of it, the wealthiest
and most populous provinces&mdash;Babylonia, Syria, Lydia, Phrygia, and the
countries of the Halys&mdash;and they were practically kings in all but name,
in spite of the <i>surveillance</i> which the general and the secretary were
supposed to exercise over their actions. Besides this, the indifference
and incapacity of the ruling sovereigns had already tended to destroy
the order of the administrative system so ably devised by Darius: the
satrap had, as a rule, absorbed the functions of a general within his
own province, and the secretary was too insignificant a personage
to retain authority and independence unless he received the constant
support of the sovereign. The latter, a tool in the hands of women and
eunuchs, usually felt himself powerless to deal with his great vassals.
His toleration went to all lengths if he could thereby avoid a revolt;
when this was inevitable, and the rebels were vanquished, he still
continued to conciliate them, and in most cases their fiefs and rights
were preserved or restored to them, the monarch knowing that he could
rid himself of them treacherously by poison or the dagger in the case
of their proving themselves too troublesome. Megabyzos by his turbulence
was a thorn in the side of Artaxerxes during the half of his reign. He
had ended his campaign in Egypt by engaging to preserve the lives of
Inaros and the 6000 Greeks who had capitulated at Byblos, and, in spite
of the anger of the king, he succeeded in keeping his word for five
years, but at the end of that time the demands of Amestris prevailed.
She succeeded in obtaining from him some fifty Greeks whom she beheaded,
besides Inaros himself, whom she impaled to avenge Achæmenes. Megabyzos,
who had not recovered from the losses he had sustained in his last
campaign against Cimon, at first concealed his anger, but he asked
permission to visit his Syrian province, and no sooner did he reach it,
than he resorted to hostilities. He defeated in succession Usiris and
Menostates, the two generals despatched against him, and when force
failed to overcome his obstinate resistance, the government condescended
to treat with him, and swore to forget the past if he would consent
to lay down arms. To this he agreed, and reappeared at court; but once
there, his confidence nearly proved fatal to him. Having been invited to
take part in a hunt, he pierced with his javelin a lion which threatened
to attack the king: Artaxerxes called to mind an ancient law which
punished by death any intervention of that kind, and he ordered that
the culprit should be beheaded. Megabyzos with difficulty escaped this
punishment through the entreaties of Amestris and of his wife Amytis;
but he was deprived of his fiefs, and sent to Kyrta, on the shores of
the Persian Gulf. After five years this exile became unbearable; he
therefore spread the report that he was attacked by leprosy, and he
returned home without any one venturing to hinder him, from fear of
defiling themselves by contact with his person. Amestris and Amytis
brought about his reconciliation with his sovereign; and thenceforward
he regulated his conduct so successfully that the past was completely
forgotten, and when he died, at the age of seventy-six years, Artaxerxes
deeply regretted his loss.*
</p>
<pre>
     * These events are known to us only through Ctesias. Their
     date is uncertain, but there is no doubt that they occurred
     after Cimon's campaign in Cyprus and the conclusion of the
     peace of Callias.
</pre>
<p>
Peace having been signed with Athens, and the revolt of Megabyzos being
at an end, Artaxerxes was free to enjoy himself without further care
for the future, and to pass his time between his various capitals and
palaces.

His choice lay between Susa and Persepolis, between Ecbatana and
Babylon, according as the heat of the summer or the cold of the winter
induced him to pass from the plains to the mountains, or from the latter
to the plains. During his visits to Babylon he occupied one of the
old Chaldæan palaces, but at Ecbatana he possessed merely the ancient
residence of the Median kings, and the seraglio built or restored by
Xerxes in the fashion of the times: at Susa and in Persia proper, the
royal buildings were entirely the work of the Achæmenids, mostly that
of Darius and Xerxes. The memory of Cyrus and of the kings to whom
primitive Persia owed her organisation in the obscure century preceding
her career of conquest, was piously preserved in the rude buildings of
Pasargadæ, which was regarded as a sacred city, whither the sovereigns
repaired for coronation as soon as their predecessors had expired.
But its lonely position and simple appointments no longer suited their
luxurious and effeminate habits, and Darius had in consequence fixed
his residence a few miles to the south of it, near to the village, which
after its development became the immense royal city of Persepolis. He
there erected buildings more suited to the splendour of his court, and
found the place so much to his taste during his lifetime, that he was
unwilling to leave it after death. He therefore caused his tomb to be
cut in the steep limestone cliff which borders the plain about half a
mile to the north-west of the town. It is an opening in the form of a
Greek cross, the upper part of which contains a bas-relief in which the
king, standing in front of the altar, implores the help of Ahura-mazdâ
poised with extended wings above him; the platform on which the king
stands is supported by two rows of caryatides in low relief, whose
features and dress are characteristic of Persian vassals, while other
personages, in groups of three on either side, are shown in the attitude
of prayer. Below, in the transverse arms of the cross, is carved a flat
portico with four columns, in the centre of which is the entrance to
the funeral vault. Within the latter, in receptacles hollowed out of the
rock, Darius and eight of his family were successively laid.
</p>
<p>
Xerxes caused a tomb in every way similar to be cut for himself near
that of Darius, and in the course of years others were added close by.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The tomb of Darius alone bears an inscription. Darius III.
     was also buried there by command of Alexander.

Both the tombs and the palace are built in that eclectic style which
characterises the Achæmenian period of Iranian art. The main features
are borrowed from the architecture of those nations which were vassals
or neighbours of the empire&mdash;Babylonia, Egypt, and Greece; but these
various elements have been combined and modified in such a manner as to
form a rich and harmonious whole.

The core of the walls was of burnt bricks, similar to those employed in
the Euphrates valley, but these were covered with a facing of enamelled
tiles, disposed as a skirting or a frieze, on which figured those
wonderful processions of archers, and the lions which now adorn the
Louvre, while the pilasters at the angles, the columns, pillars,

The doorways are high and narrow; the moulding which frames them
is formed of three Ionic fillets, each projecting beyond the other,
surmounted by a coved Egyptian lintel springing from a row of alternate
eggs and disks. The framing of the doors is bare, but the embrasures are
covered with bas-reliefs representing various scenes in which the king
is portrayed fulfilling his royal functions&mdash;engaged in struggles with
evil genii which have the form of lions or fabulous animals, occupied in
hunting, granting audiences, or making an entrance in state, shaded by
an umbrella which is borne by a eunuch behind him. The columns employed
in this style of architecture constitute its most original feature.
The base of them usually consists of two mouldings, resting either on
a square pedestal or on a cylindrical drum, widening out below into a
bell-like curve, and sometimes ornamented with several rows of inverted
leaves. The shafts, which have forty-eight perpendicular ribs cut on
their outer surface, are perhaps rather tall in proportion to their
thickness. They terminate in a group of large leaves, an evident
imitation of the Egyptian palm-leaf capital, from which spring a sort of
rectangular fluted die or abacus, flanked on either side with four rows
of volutes curved in opposite directions, generally two at the base and
two at the summit. The heads and shoulders of two bulls, placed back to
back, project above the volutes, and take the place of the usual abacus
of the capital. The dimensions of these columns, their gracefulness, and
the distance at which they were placed from one another, prove that they
supported not a stone architrave, but enormous beams of wood, which
were inserted between the napes of the bulls' necks, and upon which the
joists of the roof were superimposed. The palace of Persepolis, built by
Darius after he had crushed the revolts which took place at the outset
of his reign, was situated at the foot of a chain of rugged mountains
which skirt the plain on its eastern side, and was raised on an
irregularly shaped platform or terrace, which was terminated by a wall
of enormous polygonal blocks of masonry. The terrace was reached by
a double flight of steps, the lateral walls of which are covered
with bas-reliefs, representing processions of satellites, slaves, and
tributaries, hunting scenes, fantastic episodes of battle, and lions
fighting with and devouring bulls. The area of the raised platform was
not of uniform level, and was laid out in gardens, in the midst of which
rose the pavilions that served as dwelling-places. The reception-rooms
were placed near the top of the flight of steps, and the more important
of them had been built under the two preceding kings. Those nearest to
the edge of the platform were the propylæ of Xerxes&mdash;gigantic entrances
whose gateways were guarded on either side by winged bulls of Assyrian
type; beyond these was the <i>apadana</i>, or hall of honour, where the
sovereign presided in state at the ordinary court ceremonies. To the
east of the <i>apadana</i>, and almost in the centre of the raised terrace,
rose the Hall of a Hundred Columns, erected by Darius, and used only
on special occasions. Artaxerxes I. seems to have had a particular
affection for Susa. It had found favour with his predecessors, and they
had so frequently resided there, even after the building of Persepolis,
that it had continued to be regarded as the real capital of the empire
by other nations, whereas the Persian sovereigns themselves had sought
to make it rather an impregnable retreat than a luxurious residence.
Artaxerxes built there an <i>apadana</i> on a vaster scale than any hitherto
designed.

It comprised three colonnades, which, taken together, formed a rectangle
measuring 300 feet by 250 feet on the two sides, the area being
approximately that of the courtyard of the Louvre. The central
colonnade, which was the largest of the three, was enclosed by walls on
three sides, but was open to the south. Immense festoons of drapery hung
from the wooden entablature, and curtains, suspended from rods between
the first row of columns, afforded protection from the sun and from the
curiosity of the vulgar.

At the hour appointed for the ceremonies, the great king took his seat
in solitary grandeur on the gilded throne of the Achæmenids; at the
extreme end of the colonnade his eunuchs, nobles, and guards ranged
themselves in silence on either side, each in the place which etiquette
assigned to him. Meanwhile the foreign ambassadors who had been honoured
by an invitation to the audience&mdash;Greeks from Thebes, Sparta, or Athens;
Sakae from the regions of the north; Indians, Arabs, nomad chiefs from
mysterious Ethiopia-ascended in procession the flights of steps which
led from the town to the palace, bearing the presents destined for its
royal master.

Having reached the terrace, the curtains of the <i>apadana</i> were suddenly
parted, and in the distance, through a vista of columns, they perceived
a motionless figure, resplendent with gold and purple, before whom
they fell prostrate with their faces to the earth. The heralds were
the bearers of their greetings, and brought back to them a gracious or
haughty reply, as the case may be. When they rose from the ground, the
curtains had closed, the kingly vision was eclipsed, and the escort
which had accompanied them into the palace conducted them back to the
town, dazzled with the momentary glimpse of the spectacle vouchsafed to
them.

<p>
The Achæemenian monarchs were not regarded as gods or as sons of gods,
like the Egyptian Pharaohs, and the Persian religion forbade their
ever becoming so, but the person of the king was hedged round with such
ceremonial respect as in other Oriental nations was paid only to the
gods: this was but natural, for was he not a despot, who with a word
or gesture could abase the noblest of his subjects, and determine the
well-being or misery of his people? His dress differed from that of his
nobles only by the purple dye of its material and the richness of the
gold embroideries with which it was adorned, but he was distinguished
from all others by the peculiar felt cap, or <i>kidaris</i>, which he wore,
and the blue-and-white band which encircled it like a crown; the king
is never represented without his long sceptre with pommelled handle,
whether he be sitting or standing, and wherever he went he was attended
by his umbrella- and fan-bearers. The prescriptions of court etiquette
were such as to convince his subjects and persuade himself that he was
sprung from a nobler race than that of any of his magnates, and that he
was outside the pale of ordinary humanity. The greater part of his
time was passed in privacy, where he was attended only by the eunuchs
appointed to receive his orders; and these orders, once issued, were
irrevocable, as was also the king's word, however much he might desire
to recall a promise once made. His meals were, as a rule, served to him
alone; he might not walk on foot beyond the precincts of the palace, and
he never showed himself in public except on horseback or in his chariot,
surrounded by his servants and his guards. The male members of the royal
family and those belonging to the six noble houses enjoyed the privilege
of approaching the king at any hour of the day or night, provided he was
not in the company of one of his wives. These privileged persons formed
his council, which he convoked on important occasions, but all ordinary
business was transacted by means of the scribes and inferior officials,
on whom devolved the charge of the various departments of the
government. A vigorous ruler, such as Darius had proved himself,
certainly trusted no one but himself to read the reports sent in by the
satraps, the secretaries, and the generals, or to dictate the answers
required by each; but Xerxes and Artaxerxes delegated the heaviest part
of such business to their ministers, and they themselves only fulfilled
such state functions as it was impossible to shirk&mdash;the public
administration of justice, receptions of ambassadors or victorious
generals, distributions of awards, annual sacrifices, and state
banquets: they were even obliged, in accordance with an ancient and
inviolable tradition, once a year to set aside their usual sober habits
and drink to excess on the day of the feast of Mithra. Occasionally they
would break through their normal routine of life to conduct in person
some expedition of small importance, directed against one of the
semi-independent tribes of Iran, such as the Cadusians, but their
most glorious and frequent exploits were confined to the chase. They
delighted to hunt the bull, the wild boar, the deer, the wild ass, and
the hare, as the Pharaohs or Assyrian kings of old had done; and they
would track the lion to his lair and engage him single-handed; in fact,
they held a strict monopoly in such conflicts, a law which punished with
death any huntsman who had the impertinence to interpose between the
monarch and his prey being only abolished by Artaxerxes. A crowd of
menials, slaves, great nobles, and priests filled the palace; grooms,
stool-bearers, umbrella- and fan-carriers, <i>havasses</i>, "Immortals,"
bakers, perfumers, soldiers, and artisans formed a retinue so numerous
as to require a thousand bullocks, asses, and stags to be butchered
every day for its maintenance; and when the king made a journey in full
state, this enormous train looked like an army on the march. The women
of the royal harem lived in seclusion in a separate wing of the palace,
or in isolated buildings erected in the centre of the gardens. The
legitimate wives of the sovereign were selected from the ladies of
the royal house, the sisters or cousins of the king, and from the six
princely Persian families; but their number were never very large,
usually three or four at most.*

     and a daughter of Otanes.

society, and were counted by hundreds.

They sang or played on musical instruments at the state banquets of the
court, they accompanied their master to the battle-field or the chase,
and probably performed the various inferior domestic duties in the
interior of the harem, such as spinning, weaving, making perfumes, and
attending to the confectionery and cooking. Each of the king's wives
had her own separate suite of apartments and special attendants, and
occupied a much higher position than a mere concubine; but only one was
actually queen and had the right to wear the crown, and this position
belonged of right to a princess of Achæ-menian race. Thus Atossa,
daughter of Cyrus, was queen successively to Cambyses, Gaumâta, and
Darius; Amestris to Xerxes; and Damaspia to Artaxerxes. Besides the
influence naturally exerted by the queen over the mind of her husband,
she often acquired boundless authority in the empire, in spite of her
secluded life.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Thus Atossa induced Darius to designate Xerxes as his
     heir-apparent.
</pre>
<p>
Her power was still further increased when she became a widow, if the
new king happened to be one of her own sons. In such circumstances she
retained the external attributes of royalty, sitting at the royal
table whenever the king deigned to dine in the women's apartments, and
everywhere taking precedence of the young queen; she was attended by her
own body of eunuchs, of whom, as well as of her private revenues,
she had absolute control. Those whom the queen-mother took under her
protection escaped punishment, even though they richly deserved it,
but the object of her hatred was doomed to perish in the end, either by
poison treacherously administered, or by some horrible form of torture,
being impaled, suffocated in ashes, tortured in the trough, or flayed
alive. Artaxerxes reigned for forty-two years, spending his time between
the pleasures of the chase and the harem; no serious trouble disturbed
his repose after his suppression of the revolt under Megabyzos, but on
his death in 424 B.C. there was a renewal of the intrigues and ambitious
passions which had stained with bloodshed the opening years of his
reign. The legitimate heir, Xerxes II., was assassinated, after a reign
of forty-five days, by Secudianus (Sogdianus), one of his illegitimate
brothers, and the <i>cortège</i> which was escorting the bodies of his
parents conveyed his also to the royal burying-place at Persepolis.
Meanwhile Secudianus became suspicious of another of his brothers,
named Ochus, whom Artaxerxes had caused to marry Parysatis, one of the
daughters of Xerxes, and whom he had set over the important province of
Hyrcania. Ochus received repeated summonses to appear in his brother's
presence to pay him homage, and at last obeyed the mandate, but arrived
at the head of an army. The Persian nobility rose at his approach, and
one by one the chief persons of the state declared themselves in his
favour: first Arbarius, commander of the cavalry; then Arxanes, the
satrap of Egypt; and lastly, the eunuch Artoxares, the ruler of
Armenia. These three all combined in urging Ochus to assume the <i>Edaris</i>
publicly, which he, with feigned reluctance, consented to do, and
proceeded, at the suggestion of Parysatis, to open negotiations with
Secudianus, offering to divide the regal power with him. Secudianus
accepted the offer, against the advice of his minister Menostanes, and
gave himself up into the hands of the rebels. He was immediately seized
and cast into the ashes, where he perished miserably, after a reign of
six months and fifteen days.
</p>
<p>
On ascending the throne, Ochus assumed the name of Darius. His
confidential advisers were three eunuchs, who ruled the empire in his
name&mdash;Artoxares, who had taken such a prominent part in the campaign
which won him the crown, Artibarzanes, and Athôos; but the guiding
spirit of his government was, in reality, his wife, the detestable
Parysatis. She had already borne him two children before she became
queen; a daughter, Amestris, and a son, Arsaces, who afterwards became
king under the name of Artaxerxes. Soon after the accession of her
husband, she bore him a second son, whom she named Cyrus, in memory
of the founder of the empire, and a daughter, Artostê; several other
children were born subsequently, making thirteen in all, but these all
died in childhood, except one named Oxendras. Violent, false, jealous,
and passionately fond of the exercise of power, Parysatis hesitated at
no crime to rid herself of those who thwarted her schemes, even though
they might be members of her own family; and, not content with putting
them out of the way, she delighted in making them taste her hatred to
the full, by subjecting them to the most skilfully graduated refinements
of torture; she deservedly left behind her the reputation of being one
of the most cruel of all the cruel queens, whose memory was a terror not
only to the harems of Persia, but to the whole of the Eastern world.
The numerous revolts which broke out soon after her husband's accession,
furnished occasions for the revelation of her perfidious cleverness.
All the malcontents of the reign of Artaxerxes, those who had
been implicated in the murder of Xerxes II., or who had sided with
Secudianus, had rallied round a younger brother of Darius, named
Arsites, and one of them, Artyphios, son of Megabyzos, took the field in
Asia Minor. Being supported by a large contingent of Greek mercenaries,
he won two successive victories at the opening of the campaign, but was
subsequently defeated, though his forces still remained formidable. But
Persian gold accomplished what Persian bravery had failed to achieve,
and prevailed over the mercenaries so successfully that all deserted him
with the exception of three Milesians.

<p>
Artyphios and Arsites, thus discouraged, committed the imprudence of
capitulating on condition of receiving a promise that their lives should
be spared, and that they should be well treated; but Parysatis persuaded
her husband to break his plighted word, and they perished in the ashes.
Their miserable fate did not discourage the satrap of Lydia, Pissuthnes,
who was of Achæmenian race: he entered the lists in 418 B.C., with the
help of the Athenians. The relations between the Persian empire and
Greece had continued fairly satisfactory since the peace of 449
B.C., and the few outbreaks which had taken place had not led to any
widespread disturbance. The Athenians, absorbed in their quarrel with
Sparta, preferred to close their eyes to all side issues, lest the
Persians should declare war against them, and the satraps of Asia Minor,
fully alive to the situation, did not hesitate to take advantage of any
pretext for recovering a part of the territory they coveted: it was thus
that they had seized Colophon about 430 B.C., and so secured once more a
port on the Ægean. Darius despatched to oppose Pissuthnes a man of noble
birth, named Tissaphernes, giving him plenary power throughout the whole
of the peninsula, and Tissaphernes endeavoured to obtain by treachery
the success he would with difficulty have won on the field of battle: he
corrupted by his darics Lycon, the commander of the Athenian contingent,
and Pissuthnes, suddenly abandoned by his best auxiliaries, was forced
to surrender at discretion. He also was suffocated in the ashes, and
Darius bestowed his office on Tissaphernes.
</p>
<p>
But the punishment of Pissuthnes did not put an end to the troubles:
his son Amorges roused Caria to revolt, and with the title of king
maintained his independence for some years longer. While these incidents
were taking place, the news of the disasters in Sicily reached the East:
as soon as it was known in Susa that Athens had lost at Syracuse the
best part of her fleet and the choicest of her citizens, the moment was
deemed favourable to violate the treaty and regain control of the whole
of Asia Minor. Two noteworthy men were at that time set over the
western satrapies, Tissaphernes ruling at Sardes, and Tiribazus over
Hellespontine Phrygia. These satraps opened negotiations with Sparta
at the beginning of 412 B.C., and concluded a treaty with her at
Miletus itself, by the terms of which the Peloponnesians recognised the
suzerainty of Darius over all the territory once held by his ancestors
in Asia, including the cities since incorporated into the Athenian
league. They hoped shortly to be strong enough to snatch from him what
they now ceded, and to set free once more the Greeks whom they thus
condemned to servitude after half a century of independence, but their
expectations were frustrated. The towns along the coast fell one after
another into the power of Tissaphernes, Amorges was taken prisoner in
lassos, and at the beginning of 411 B.C. there remained to the Athenians
in Ionia and Caria merely the two ports of Halicarnassus and Notium, and
the three islands of Cos, Samos, and Lesbos: from that time the power of
the great king increased from year to year, and weighed heavily on the
destinies of Greece. Meanwhile Darius II. was growing old, and intrigues
with regard to the succession were set on foot. Two of his sons put
forward claims to the throne: Arsaces had seniority in his favour, but
had been born when his father was still a mere satrap; Cyrus, on the
contrary, had been born in the purple, and his mother Parysatis
was passionately devoted to him.* Thanks to her manouvres, he was
practically created viceroy of Asia Minor in 407 B.C., with such
abundant resources of men and money at his disposal, that he was
virtually an independent sovereign. While he was consolidating his
power in the west, his mother endeavoured to secure his accession to the
throne by intriguing at the court of the aged king; if her plans failed,
Cyrus was prepared to risk everything by an appeal to arms.
</p>
<pre>

     407 B.C., evening admitting that he was born immediately

He realised that the Greeks would prove powerful auxiliaries in such
a contingency; and as soon as he had set up his court at Sardes, he
planned how best to conciliate their favour, or at least to win over
those whose support was likely to be most valuable. Athens, as a
maritime power, was not in a position to support him in an enterprise
which especially required the co-operation of a considerable force of
heavily armed infantry. He therefore deliberately espoused the cause
of the Peloponnesians, and the support he gave them was not without its
influence on the issue of the struggle: the terrible day of Ægos Potamos
was a day of triumph for him as much as for the Lacedaemonians (405
B.C.).
</p>
<p>
His intimacy with Lysander, however, his constant enlistments of
mercenary troops, and his secret dealings with the neighbouring
provinces, had already aroused suspicion, and the satraps placed under
his orders, especially Tissaphernes, accused him to the king of treason.
Darius summoned him to Susa to explain his conduct (405 B.C.), and he
arrived just in time to be present at his father's death (404), but
too late to obtain his designation as heir to the throne through the
intervention of his mother, Parysatis; Arsaces inherited the crown, and
assumed the name of Artaxerxes.

Cyrus entered the temple of Pasargadae surreptitiously during the
coronation ceremony, with the intention of killing his brother at the
foot of the altar; but Tissaphernes, warned by one of the priests,
denounced him, and he would have been put to death on the spot, had not
his mother thrown her arms around him and prevented the executioner from
fulfilling his office. Having with difficulty obtained pardon and been
sent back to his province, he collected thirty thousand Greeks and a
hundred thousand native troops, and, hastily leaving Sardes (401 B.C.),
he crossed Asia Minor, Northern Syria, and Mesopotamia, encountered the
royal army at Cunaxa, to the north of Babylon, and rashly met his end
at the very moment of victory. He was a brave, active, and generous
prince, endowed with all the virtues requisite to make a good Oriental
monarch, and he had, moreover, learnt, through contact with the Greeks,
to recognise the weak points of his own nation, and was fully determined
to remedy them: his death, perhaps, was an irreparable misfortune for
his country. Had he survived and supplanted the feeble Artaxerxes, it is
quite possible that he might have confirmed and strengthened the power
of Persia, or, at least, temporarily have arrested its decline. Having
lost their leader, his Asiatic followers at once dispersed; but the
mercenaries did not lose heart, and, crossing Asia and Armenia, gained
at length the shores of the Black Sea. Up to that time the Greeks had
looked upon Persia as a compact state, which they were sufficiently
powerful to conquer by sea and hold in check by land, but which
they could not, without imprudence, venture to attack within its own
frontiers. The experience of the Ten Thousand was a proof to them that
a handful of men, deprived of their proper generals, without guides,
money, or provisions, might successfully oppose the overwhelming forces
of the great king, and escape from his clutches without any serious
difficulty. National discords prevented them from at once utilising
the experience they thus acquired, but the lesson was not lost upon
the court of Susa. The success of Lysander had been ensured by Persian
subsidies, and now Sparta hesitated to fulfil the conditions of the
treaty of Miletus; the Lacedæmonians demanded liberty once more for the
former allies of Athens, fostered the war in Asia in order to enforce
their claims, and their king Agesilaus, penetrating to the very heart of
Phrygia, would have pressed still further forward in the tracks of the
Ten Thousand, had not an opportune diversion been created in his rear by
the bribery of the Persians. Athens once more flew to arms: her fleet,
in conjunction with the Phoenicians, took possession of Cythera; the
Long Walls were rebuilt at the expense of the great king, and Sparta,
recalled by these reverses to a realisation of her position, wisely
abandoned her inclination for distant enterprises. Asia Minor was
reconquered, and Persia passed from the position of a national enemy
to that of the friend and arbiter of Greece; but she did so by force of
circumstances only, and not from having merited in any way the supremacy
she attained. Her military energy, indeed, was far from being exhausted;
but poor Artaxerxes, bewildered by the rivalries between his mother and
his wives, did not know how to make the most of the immense resources
still at his disposal, and he met with repeated checks as soon as he
came face to face with a nation and leaders who refused to stoop to
treachery. He had no sooner recovered possession of the Ægean littoral
than Egypt was snatched from his grasp by a new Pharaoh who had arisen
in the Nile valley. The peace had not been seriously disturbed in Egypt
during the forty years which had elapsed since the defeat of Inarus.
Satrap had peaceably succeeded satrap in the fortress of Memphis;
the exhaustion of Libya had pre-vented any movement on the part of
Thannyras; the aged Amyrtæus had passed from the scene, and his son,
Pausiris, bent his neck submissively to the Persian yoke. More than
once, however, unexpected outbursts had shown that the fires of
rebellion were still smouldering. A Psammetichus, who reigned about 445
B.C. in a corner of the Delta, had dared to send corn and presents to
the Athenians, then at war with Artaxerxes I., and the second year of
Darius II. had been troubled by a sanguinary sedition, which, however,
was easily suppressed by the governor then in power; finally, about
410 B.C., a king of Egypt had, not without some show of evidence,
laid himself open to the charge of sending a piratical expedition into
Phoenician waters, an Arab king having contributed to the enterprise.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The revolt mentioned by Ctesias has nothing to do with the
     insurrection of the satrap of Egypt which is here referred
     to, the date of which is furnished by the Syncellus.
</pre>
<p>
It was easy to see, moreover, from periodical revolts&mdash;such as that of
Megabyzos in Syria, those of Artyphios and Arsites, of Pissuthnes and
Amorges in Asia Minor&mdash;with what impunity the wrath of the great king
could be defied: it was not to be wondered at, therefore, that, about
405 B.C., an enemy should appear in the heart of the Delta in the person
of a grandson and namesake of Amyrtæus. He did not at first rouse the
whole country to revolt, for Egyptian troops were still numbered in the
army of Artaxerxes at the battle of Cunaxa in 401 B.C.; but he succeeded
in establishing a regular native government, and struggled so resolutely
against the foreign domination that the historians of the sacred
colleges inscribed his name on the list of the Pharaohs. He is there
made to represent a whole dynasty, the XXVIIIth which lasted six years,
coincident with the six years of his reign. It was due to a Mendesian
dynasty, however, whose founder was Nephorites, that Egypt obtained its
entire freedom, and was raised once more to the rank of a nation. This
dynasty from the very outset adopted the policy which had proved so
successful in the case of the Saites three centuries previously, and
employed it with similar success. Egypt had always been in the position
of a besieged fortress, which needed, for its complete security, that
its first lines of defence should be well in advance of its citadel: she
must either possess Syria or win her as an ally, if she desired to be
protected against all chance of sudden invasion. Nephorites and his
successors, therefore, formed alliances beyond the isthmus, and even on
the other side of the Mediterranean, with Cyprus, Caria, and Greece, in
one case to purchase support, and in another to re-establish the ancient
supremacy exercised by the Theban Pharaohs.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This is, at any rate, the idea given of him by Egyptian
     tradition in the time of the Ptolemies, as results from a
     passage in the <i>Demotic Rhapsody</i>, where his reign is
     mentioned.
</pre>
<p>
Every revolt against the Persians, every quarrel among the satraps,
helped forward their cause, since they compelled the great king to
suspend his attacks against Egypt altogether or to prosecute them at
wide intervals: the Egyptians therefore fomented such quarrels, or even,
at need, provoked them, and played their game so well that for a long
time they had to oppose only a fraction of the Persian forces. Like the
Saite Pharaohs before them, they were aware how little reliance could
be placed on native troops, and they recruited their armies at great
expense from the European Greeks. This occurred at the time when
mercenary forces were taking the place of native levies throughout
Hellas, and war was developing into a lucrative trade for those who
understood how to conduct it: adventurers, greedy for booty, flocked
to the standards of the generals who enjoyed the best reputation for
kindness or ability, and the generals themselves sold their services
to the highest bidder. The Persian kings took large advantage of this
arrangement to procure troops: the Pharaohs imitated their example, and
in the years which followed, the most experienced captains, Iphicrates,
Chabrias, and Timotheus, passed from one camp to another, as often
against the will as with the consent of their fatherland. The power of
Sparta was at her zenith when Nephorites ascended the throne, and she
was just preparing for her expedition to Phrygia. The Pharaoh concluded
an alliance with the Lacedomonians, and in 396 B.C. sent to Agesilaus
a fleet laden with arms, corn, and supplies, which, however, was
intercepted by Conon, who was at that moment cruising in the direction
of Rhodes in command of the Persian squadron. This misadventure and the
abrupt retreat of the Spartans from Asia Minor cooled the good will of
the Egyptian king towards his allies. Thinking that they had abandoned
him, and that he was threatened with an imminent attack on the shore
of the Delta, he assembled, probably at Pelusium, the forces he had
apparently intended for a distant enterprise.
</p>
<p>
Matters took longer to come to a crisis than he had expected. The
retreat of Agesilaus had not pacified the Ægean satrapies; after the
disturbance created by Cyrus the Younger, the greater number of the
native tribes&mdash;Mysians, Pisidians, people of Pontus and Paphlagonia&mdash;had
shaken off the Persian yoke, and it was a matter of no small difficulty
to reduce them once more to subjection. Their incessant turbulence gave
Egypt time to breathe and to organise new combinations. Cyprus entered
readily into her designs. Since the subjugation of that island in 445
B.C., the Greek cities had suffered terrible oppression at the hands of
the great king. Artaxerxes I., despairing of reducing them to obedience,
depended exclusively for support on the Phoenician inhabitants of the
island, who, through his favour, regained so much vigour that in the
space of less than two generations they had recovered most of the ground
lost during the preceding centuries: Semitic rulers replaced the Achaean
tyrants at Salamis, and in most of the other cities, and Citium became
what it had been before the rise of Salamis, the principal commercial
centre in the island. Evagoras, a descendant of the ancient kings,
endeavoured to retrieve the Grecian cause: after driving out of Salamis
Abdemon, its Tyrian ruler, he took possession of all the other towns
except Citium and Amathus. This is not the place to recount the
brilliant part played by Evagoras, in conjunction with Conon, during the
campaigns against the Spartans in the Peloponnesian war. The activity he
then displayed and the ambitious designs he revealed soon drew upon him
the dislike of the Persian governors and their sovereign; and from
391 B.C. he was at open war with Persia. He would have been unable,
single-handed, to maintain the struggle for any length of time, but
Egypt and Greece were at his back, ready to support him with money or
arms. Hakoris had succeeded Nephorites I. in 393 B.C.,* and had repulsed
an attack of Artaxerxes between 390 and 386.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The length of the reign of Nephorites I. is fixed at six
     years by the lists of Manetho; the last-known date of his
     reign is that of his fourth year, on a mummy-bandage
     preserved in the Louvre.

     ** This war is alluded to by several ancient authors in
     passages which have been brought together and explained by
     Judeah; but unfortunately the detailed history of the
     events is not known.
</pre>
<p>
He was not unduly exalted by his success, and had immediately taken wise
precautions in view of a second invasion. After safeguarding his western
frontier by concluding a treaty with the Libyans of Barca, he entered
into an alliance with Evagoras and the Athenians.

He sent lavish gifts of corn to the Cypriots, as well as munitions of
war, ships, and money while Athens sent them several thousand men under
the command of Chabrias; not only did an expedition despatched
against them under Autophradates fail miserably, but Evagoras seized
successively Citium and Amathus, and, actually venturing across the sea,
took Tyre by assault and devastated Phoenicia and Cilicia. The princes
of Asia Minor were already preparing for revolt, and one of them,
Hecatomnus of Caria, had openly joined the allies, when Sparta suddenly
opened negotiations with Persia: Antalcidas presented himself at Susa
to pay homage before the throne of the great king. The treaty of Miletus
had brought the efforts of Athens to naught, and sold the Asiatic
Greeks to their oppressors: the peace obtained by Antalcidas effaced the
results of Salamis and Platsæ, and laid European Greece prostrate at
the feet of her previously vanquished foes. An order issuing from the
centre of Persia commanded the cities of Greece to suspend hostilities
and respect each other's liberties; the issuing of such an order was
equivalent to treating them as vassals whose quarrels it is the function
of the suzerain to repress, but they nevertheless complied with the
command (387 B.C.), Artaxerxes, relieved from anxiety for the moment,
as to affairs on the Ægean, was now free to send his best generals into
the rebel countries, and such was the course his ministers recommended.
Evagoras was naturally the first to be attacked. Cyprus was, in fact, an
outpost of Egypt; commanding as she did the approach by sea, she was in
a position to cut the communications of any army, which, issuing from
Palestine, should march upon the Delta. Artaxerxes assembled three
hundred thousand foot-soldiers and three hundred triremes under the
command of Tiribazus, and directed the whole force against the island.
At first the Cypriot cruisers intercepted the convoys which were
bringing provisions for this large force, and by so doing reduced the
invaders to such straits that sedition broke out in their camp; but
Evagoras was defeated at sea off the promontory of Citium, and
his squadron destroyed. He was not in any way discouraged by this
misfortune, but leaving his son, Pnytagoras, to hold the barbarian
forces in check, he hastened to implore the help of the Pharaoh (385
B.C.). But Hakoris was too much occupied with securing his own immediate
safety to risk anything in so desperate an enterprise. Evagoras was
able to bring back merely an insufficient subsidy; he shut himself up
in Salamis, and there maintained the conflict for some years longer.
Meanwhile Hakoris, realising that the submission of Cyprus would oppose
his flank to attack, tried to effect a diversion in Asia Minor, and by
entering into alliance with the Pisidians, then in open insurrection, he
procured for it a respite, of which he himself took advantage to prepare
for the decisive struggle. The peace effected by Antalcidas had left
most of the mercenary soldiers of Greece without employment. Hakoris
hired twenty thousand of them, and the Phoenician admirals, still
occupied in blockading the ports of Cyprus, failed to intercept the
vessels which brought him these reinforcements. It was fortunate for
Egypt that they did so, for the Pharaoh died in 381 B.C., and his
successors, Psamuthis IL, Mutis, and Nephorites IL, each occupied the
throne for a very short time, and the whole country was in confusion for
rather more than two years (381-379 B.c.) during the settlement of the
succession.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Hakoris reigned thirteen years, from 393 to 381 B.C. The
     reigns of the three succeeding kings occupied only two years
     and four months between them, from the end of 381 to the
     beginning of 378. Muthes or Mutis, who is not mentioned in
     all the lists of Manetho, seems to have his counterpart in
     the <i>Demotic Rhapsody</i>. Wiedemann has inverted the order
     usually adopted, and proposed the following series:
     Nephorites I., Muthes, Psamuthis, Hakoris, Nephorites II.
     The discovery at Karnak of a small temple where Psamuthis
     mentions Hakoris as his predecessor shows that on this point
     at least Manetho was well informed.
</pre>
<p>
The turbulent disposition of the great feudatory nobles, which had so
frequently brought trouble upon previous Pharaohs during the
Assyrian wars, was no less dangerous in this last century of Egyptian
independence; it caused the fall of the Mendesian dynasty in the very
face of the enemy, and the prince of Sebennytos, Nakht-har-habît,
Nectanebo I., was raised to the throne by the military faction.
According to a tradition current in Ptolemaic times, this sovereign was
a son of Nephorites I., who had been kept out of his heritage by the
jealousy of the gods; whatever his origin, the people had no cause
to repent of having accepted him as their king. He began his reign
by suppressing the slender subsidies which Evagoras had continued to
receive from his predecessors, and this measure, if not generous, was
at least politic. For Cyprus was now virtually in the power of the
Persians, and the blockade of a few thousand men in Salamis did not
draught away a sufficiently large proportion of their effective force to
be of any service to Egypt: the money which had hitherto been devoted to
the Cypriots was henceforth reserved for the direct defence of the Nile
valley. Evagoras obtained unexpectedly favourable conditions: Artaxerxes
conceded to him his title of king and the possession of his city (383
B.C.), and turned his whole attention to Nectanebo, the last of his
enemies who still held out.
</p>
<p>
Nectanebo had spared no pains in preparing effectively to receive his
foe. He chose as his coadjutor the Athenian Chabrias, whose capacity as
a general had been manifested by recent events, and the latter accepted
this office although he had received no instructions from his government
to do so, and had transformed the Delta into an entrenched camp. He had
fortified the most vulnerable points along the coast, had built towers
at each of the mouths of the river to guard the entrance, and had
selected the sites for his garrison fortresses so judiciously that they
were kept up long after his time to protect the country. Two of them are
mentioned by name: one, situated below Pelusium, called the Castle of
Chabrias; the other, not far from Lake Mareotis, which was known as his
township.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Both are mentioned by Strabo; the exact sites of these two
     places are not yet identified. Diodorus Siculus, describing
     the defensive preparations of Egypt, does not state
     expressly that they were the work of Chabrias, but this fact
     seems to result from a general consideration of the context.

The Persian generals endeavoured to make their means of attack
proportionate to the defences of the enemy. Acre was the only port in
Southern Syria large enough to form the rendezvous for a fleet, where it
might be secure from storms and surprises of the enemy. This was chosen
as the Persian headquarters, and formed the base of their operations.
During three years they there accumulated supplies of food and military
stores, Phoenician and Creek vessels, and both foreign and native
troops. The rivalries between the military commanders, Tithraustes,
Datâmes, and Abrocomas, and the intrigues of the court, had on several
occasions threatened the ruin of the enterprise, but Pharnabazus, who
from the outset had held supreme command, succeeded in ridding himself
of his rivals, and in the spring of 374 B.C. was at length ready for
the advance. The expedition consisted of two hundred thousand Asiatic
troops, and twenty thousand Greeks, three hundred triremes, two hundred
galleys of thirty oars, and numerous transports. Superiority of numbers
was on the side of the Persians, and that just at the moment when
Nectanebo lost his most experienced general. Artaxerxes had remonstrated
with the Athenians for permitting one of their generals to serve in
Egypt, in spite of their professed friendship for himself, and, besides
insisting on his recall, had requested for himself the services of the
celebrated Iphicrates. The Athenians complied with his demand, and while
summoning Chabrias to return to Athens, despatched Iphicrates to Syria,
where he was placed in command of the mercenary troops. Pharnabazus
ordered a general advance in May, 374 B.C.,* but when he arrived before
Pelusium, he perceived that he was not in a position to take the town
by storm; not only had the fortifications been doubled, but the banks of
the canals had been cut and the approaches inundated. Iphicrates advised
him not to persevere in attempting a regular siege: he contended that it
would be more profitable to detach an expeditionary force towards some
less well-protected point on the coast, and there to make a breach in
the system of defence which protected the enemies' front.
</p>
<pre>
     * As Kenrick justly observes, "the Persian and Athenian
     generals committed the same mistake which led to the defeat
     of Saint Louis and the capture of his army in 1249 A.D., and
     which Bonaparte avoided in his campaign of 1798." Anyhow, it
     seems that the fault must be laid on Pharnabazus alone, and
     that Iphicrates was entirely blameless.
</pre>
<p>
Three thousand men were despatched with all secrecy to the mouth of the
Mendesian branch of the Nile, and there disembarked unexpectedly before
the forts which guarded the entrance. The garrison, having imprudently
made a sortie in face of the enemy, was put to rout, and pursued so
hotly that victors and vanquished entered pell-mell within the walls.

<p>
After this success victory was certain, if the Persians pursued their
advantage promptly and pushed forward straight into the heart of the
Delta; the moment was the more propitious for such a movement, since
Nectanebo had drained Memphis of troops to protect his frontier.
Iphicrates, having obtained this information from one of the prisoners,
advised Pharnabazus to proceed up the Nile with the fleet, and take
the capital by storm before the enemy should have time to garrison it
afresh; the Persian general, however, considered the plan too hazardous,
and preferred to wait until the entire army should have joined him.
Iphicrates offered to risk the adventure with his body of auxiliary
troops only, but was suspected of harbouring some ambitious design, and
was refused permission to advance. Meanwhile these delays had given the
Egyptians time to recover from their first alarm; they boldly took
the offensive, surrounded the position held by Pharnabazus, and were
victorious in several skirmishes. Summer advanced, the Nile rose more
rapidly than usual, and soon the water encroached upon the land; the
invaders were obliged to beat a retreat before it, and fall back towards
Syria. Iphicrates, disgusted at the ineptitude and suspicion of his
Asiatic colleagues, returned secretly to Greece: the remains of the
army were soon after disbanded, and Egypt once more breathed freely.
The check received by the Persian arms, however, was not sufficiently
notorious to shake that species of supremacy which Artaxerxes had
exercised in Greece since the peace of 387. Sparta, Thebes, and Athens
vied with each other in obtaining an alliance with him as keenly as if
he had been successful before Pelusium. Antalcidas reappeared at Susa in
372 B.C. to procure a fresh act of intervention; Pelopidas and Ismenias,
in 367, begged for a rescript similar to that of Antalcidas; and finally
Athens sent a solemn embassy to entreat for a subsidy. It seemed as if
the great king had become a kind of supreme arbiter for Greece, and that
all the states hitherto leagued against him now came in turn to submit
their mutual differences for his decision. But this arbiter who thus
imposed his will on states beyond the borders of his empire was never
fully master within his own domains. Of gentle nature and pliant
disposition, inclined to clemency rather than to severity, and,
moreover, so lacking in judgment as a general that he had almost
succumbed to an attack by the Cadusians on the only occasion that he
had, in a whim of the moment, undertaken the command of an army in
person, Artaxerxes busied himself with greater zeal in religious reforms
than in military projects. He introduced the rites of Mithra and Anâhita
into the established religion of the state, but he had not the energy
necessary to curb the ambitions of his provincial governors. Asia Minor,
whose revolts followed closely on those of Egypt, rose in rebellion
against him immediately after the campaign on the Nile, Ariobarzanes
heading the rebellion in Phrygia, Datâmes and Aspis that in Cilicia and
Cappadocia, and both defying his power for several years. When at length
they succumbed through treachery, the satraps of the Mediterranean
district, from the Hellespont to the isthmus of Suez, formed a coalition
and simultaneously took the field: the break-up of the empire would have
been complete had not Persian darics been lavishly employed once more in
the affair. Meanwhile Nectanebo had died in 361,* and had been succeeded
by Tachôs.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The lists of Manetho assign ten or eighteen years to his
     reign. A sarcophagus in Vienna bears the date of his
     fifteenth year, and the great inscription of Edfu speaks of
     gifts he made to the temple in this town in the eighteenth
     year of his reign. The reading eighteen is therefore
     preferable to the reading ten in the lists of Manetho; if
     the very obscure text of the <i>Demotic Rhapsody</i> really
     applies the number nine or ten to the length of the reign,
     this reckoning must be explained by some mystic calculations
     of the priests of the Ptolemaic epoch.

     ** The name of this king, written by the Greeks Teôs or
     Tachôs, in accordance with the pronunciation of different
     Egyptian dialects, has been discovered in hieroglyphic
     writing on the external wall of the temple of Khonsu at
     Karnak.
</pre>
<p>
The new Pharaoh deemed the occasion opportune to make a diversion
against Persia and to further secure his own safety: he therefore
offered his support to the satraps, who sent Eheomitres as a delegate
to discuss the terms of an offensive and defensive alliance. Having
inherited from Nectanebo a large fleet and a full treasury, Tachôs
entrusted to the ambassador 500 talents of silver, and gave him fifty
ships, with which he cruised along the coast of Asia Minor towards
Leukê. His accomplices were awaiting him there, rejoicing at the success
of his mission, but he himself had no confidence in the final issue of
the struggle, and merely sought how he might enter once more into favour
with the Persian court; he therefore secured his safety by betraying his
associates. He handed over the subsidies and the Egyptian squadron to
Orontes, the satrap of Daskylium, and then seizing the insurgent
chiefs sent them in chains to Susa. These acts of treachery changed
the complexion of affairs; the league suddenly dissolved after the
imprisonment of its leaders, and Arta-xerxes re-established his
authority over Asia Minor.
</p>


<p>
Egypt became once more the principal object of attack, and by the
irony of fate Pharaoh had himself contributed to enrich the coffers and
reinforce the fleet of his foes. In spite of this mischance, however,
circumstances were so much in his favour that he ventured to consider
whether it would not be more advantageous to forestall the foe by
attacking him, rather than passively to await an onslaught behind his
own lines. He had sought the friendship of Athens,* and, though it had
not been granted in explicit terms, the republic had, nevertheless,
permitted Ghabrias to resume his former post at his side.
</p>
<pre>
     * The memory of this embassy has been preserved for us by a
     decree of the Athenian assembly, unfortunately much
     mutilated, which has been assigned to various dates between
     362 and 358 B.C. M. Paul Foucart has shown that the date of
     the decree must be referred to one of three archon-ships&mdash;
     the archonship of Callimedes, 360-59; that of Eucharistus,
     359-8; or that of Cephisodotus, 358-7^ Without entering into
     a discussion of the other evidence on the subject, it seems
     to me probable that the embassy may be most conveniently
     assigned to the archonship of Callimedes, towards the end of
     360 B.C., at the moment when Chabrias had just arrived in
     Egypt, and was certain to endeavour to secure the help of
     Athens for the king he served.

Chabrias exhorted him to execute his project, and as he had not
sufficient money to defray the expenses of a long campaign outside his
own borders, the Athenian general instructed him how he might procure
the necessary funds. He suggested to him that, as the Egyptian priests
were wealthy, the sums of money annually assigned to them for the
sacrifices and maintenance of the temples would be better employed
in the service of the state, and counselled him to reduce or even to
suppress most of the sacerdotal colleges. The priests secured their own
safety by abandoning their personal property, and the king graciously
deigned to accept their gifts, and then declared to them that in future,
as long as the struggle against Persia continued, he should exact from
them nine-tenths of their sacred revenues. This tax would have sufficed
for all requirements if it had been possible to collect it in full, but
there is no doubt that very soon the priests must have discovered means
of avoiding part of the payment, for it was necessary to resort to other
expedients. Chabrias advised that the poll and house taxes should be
increased; that one obol should be exacted for each "ardeb" of corn
sold, and a tithe levied on the produce of all ship-building yards,
manufactories, and manual industries. Money now poured into the
treasury, but a difficulty arose which demanded immediate solution.
Egypt possessed very little specie, and the natives still employed
barter in the ordinary transactions of life, while the foreign
mercenaries refused to accept payment in kind or uncoined metal; they
demanded good money as the price of their services. Orders were issued
to the natives to hand over to the royal exchequer all the gold and
silver in their possession, whether wrought or in ingots, the state
guaranteeing gradual repayment through the nomarchs from the future
product of the poll-tax, and the bullion so obtained was converted into
specie for the payment of the auxiliary troops. These measures, though
winning some unpopularity for Tachôs, enabled him to raise eighty
thousand native troops and ten thousand Greeks, to equip a fleet of
two hundred vessels, and to engage the best generals of the period. His
eagerness to secure the latter, however, was injurious to his cause.
Having already engaged Chabrias and obtained the good will of Athens, he
desired also to gain the help of Agesilaus and the favourable opinion
of the Lacedaemonians. Though now eighty years old, Agesilaus was still
under the influence of cupidity and vanity; the promise of being placed
in supreme command enticed him, and he set sail with one thousand
hoplites. A disappointment awaited him at the moment of his
disembarkation: Tachôs gave him command of the mercenary troops only,
reserving for himself the general direction of operations, and placing
the whole fleet under the orders of Chabrias. The aged hero, having
vented his indignation by indulging a more than ordinary display of
Spartan rudeness, allowed himself to be appeased by abundant presents,
and assumed the post assigned to him. But soon after a more serious
subject of disagreement arose between him and his ally; Agesilaus was
disposed to think that Tachôs should remain quietly on the banks of the
Nile, and leave to his generals the task of conducting the campaign.
The ease with which mercenary leaders passed from one camp to the other,
according to the fancy of the moment, was not calculated to inspire the
Egyptian Pharaoh with confidence: he refused to comply with the wishes
of Agesilaus, and, entrusting the regency to one of his relatives,
proceeded to invade Syria. He found the Persians unprepared: they shut
themselves up in their strongholds, and the Pharaoh confided to his
cousin Nectanebo, son of the regent, the task of dislodging them. The
war dragged on for some time; discontent crept in among the native
levies, and brought treachery in its train. The fiscal measures which
had been adopted had exasperated the priests and the common people;
complaints, at first only muttered in fear, found bold expression as
soon as the expeditionary force had crossed the frontier.

The regent secretly encouraged the malcontents, and wrote to his son
warning him of what was going on, and advised him to seize the crown.
Nectanebo could easily have won over the Egyptian troops to his cause,
but their support would have proved useless as long as the Greeks did
not pronounce in his favour, and Chabrias refused to break his oaths.
Agesilaus, however, was not troubled by the same scruples. His vanity
had been sorely wounded by the Pharaoh: after being denied the position
which was, he fancied, his by right, his short stature, his ill-health,
and native coarseness had exposed him to the unseemly mockery of the
courtiers. Tachôs, considering his ability had been over-estimated,
applied to him, it is said, the fable of the mountain bringing forth a
mouse; to which he had replied, "When opportunity offers, I will prove
to him that I am the lion." When Tachôs requested him to bring the
rebels to order, he answered ironically that he was there to help the
Egyptians, not to attack them; and before giving his support to either
of the rival claimants, he should consult the Ephors. The Ephors
enjoined him to act in accordance with the welfare of his country, and
he thereupon took the side of Nectanebo, despite the remonstrances of
Chabrias. Tachôs, deserted by his veterans, fled to Sidon, and thence to
Susa, where Artaxerxes received him hospitably and without reproaching
him (359 B.C.); but the news of his fall was not received on the banks
of the Nile with as much rejoicing as he had anticipated. The people had
no faith in any revolution in which the Greeks whom they detested took
the chief part, and the feudal lords refused to acknowledge a sovereign
whom they had not themselves chosen; they elected one of their
number&mdash;the prince of Mendes&mdash;to oppose Nectanebo. The latter was
obliged to abandon the possessions won by his predecessor, and return
with his army to Egypt: he there encountered the forces of his enemy,
which, though as yet undisciplined, were both numerous and courageous.
Agesilaus counselled an immediate attack before these troops had time to
become experienced in tactics, but he no longer stood well at court;
the prince of Mendes had endeavoured to corrupt him, and, though he had
shown unexpected loyalty, many, nevertheless, suspected his good
faith. Nectanebo set up his headquarters at Tanis, where he was shortly
blockaded by his adversary. It is well known how skilfully the Egyptians
handled the pick-axe, and how rapidly they could construct walls of
great strength; the circle of entrenchments was already near completion,
and provisions were beginning to fail, when Agesilaus received
permission to attempt a sortie. He broke through the besieging lines
under cover of the night, and some days later won a decisive victory
(359 B.C.). Nectanebo would now have gladly kept the Spartan general at
his side, for he was expecting a Persian attack; but Agesilaus, who had
had enough of Egypt and its intrigues, deserted his cause, and shortly
afterwards died of exhaustion on the coast near Cyrene. The anticipated
Persian invasion followed shortly after, but it was conducted without
energy or decision. Artaxerxes had entrusted the conduct of the
expedition to Tachôs, doubtless promising to reinstate him in his former
power as satrap or vassal king of Egypt, but Tachôs died before he could
even assume his post,* and the discords which rent the family of the
Persian king prevented the generals who replaced him from taking any
effective action.

The aged Artaxerxes had had, it was reported, one hundred and fifteen
sons by the different women in his harem, but only three of those by his
queen Statira were now living&mdash;Darius, Ariaspes, and Ochus. Darius,
the eldest of the three, had been formally recognised as
heir-apparent&mdash;perhaps at the time of the disastrous war against the
Cadusians* &mdash;but the younger brother, Ochus, who secretly aspired to
the throne, had managed to inspire him with anxiety with regard to
the succession, and incited him to put the aged king out of the way.
Contemporary historians, ill informed as to the intrigues in the
palace, whose effects they noted without any attempt to explore their
intricacies, invented several stories to account for the conduct of the
young prince. Some assigned as the reason of his conspiracy a romantic
love-affair. They said that Cyrus the Younger had had an Ionian mistress
named Aspasia, who, after the fatal battle of Cunaxa, had been taken
into the harem of the conqueror, and had captivated him by her beauty.
Darius conceived a violent passion for this damsel, and his father was
at first inclined to give her up to him, but afterwards, repenting of
his complaisance, consecrated her to the service of Mithra, a cult which
imposed on her the obligation of perpetual chastity. Darius, exasperated
by this treatment, began to contemplate measures of vengeance, but,
being betrayed by his brother Ochus, was put to death with his whole
family.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Pompeius Trogus asserts that such co-regencies were
     contrary to Persian law; we have seen above that, on the
     contrary, they were obligatory when the sovereign was
     setting out on a campaign.

     ** This is the version of the story given by Dinon and
     accepted by Pompoius Trogus. A chronological calculation
     easily demonstrates its unlikelihood. It follows from the
     evidence given by Justin himself that Artaxerxes died of
     grief soon after the execution of his son; but, on the other
     hand, that the battle of Cunaxa took place in 400 B.C.:
     Aspasia must then have been fifty or sixty years old when
     Darius fell in love with her.
</pre>
<p>
By the removal of this first obstacle the crafty prince found himself
only one step nearer success, for his brother Ariaspes was acknowledged
as heir-apparent: Ochus therefore persuaded him that their father,
convinced of the complicity of Ariaspes in the plot imputed to Darius,
intended to put him to an ignominious death, and so worked upon him that
he committed suicide to escape the executioner. A bastard named Arsames,
who might possibly have aspired to the crown, was assassinated by Ochus.
This last blow was too much for Artaxerxes, and he died of grief after a
reign of forty-six years (358 B.C.).* Ochus, who immediately assumed the
name of Artaxerxes, began his reign by the customary massacre: he put to
death all the princes of the royal family,** and having thus rid
himself of all the rival claimants to the supreme power, he hastened on
preparations for the war with Egypt which had been interrupted by his
father's death and his own accession.
</p>
<pre>
     * This is the length attributed by Plutarch to this reign,
     and which is generally accepted. It was narrated in after-
     days that the king kept the fact of his father's death
     hidden for ten months, but it is impossible to tell how much
     truth there is in this statement, which was accepted by
     Dinon.

     ** According to the author followed by Pompeius Trogus, the
     princesses themselves were involved in this massacre. This
     is certainly an exaggeration, for we shall shortly see that
     Darius III., the last king of Persia, was accounted to be
     the grandson of Darius II.; the massacre can only have
     involved the direct heirs of Artaxerxes.
</pre>
<p>
The necessity for restoring Persian dominion on the banks of the Nile
was then more urgent than at any previous time. During the half-century
which had elapsed since the recovery of her independence, Egypt had
been a perpetual source of serious embarrassment to the great king. The
contemporaries of Amyrtseus, whether Greeks or barbarians, had at first
thought that his revolt was nothing more than a local rising, like many
a previous one which had lasted but a short time and had been promptly
suppressed. But when it was perceived that the native dynasties had
taken a hold upon the country, and had carried on a successful contest
with Persia, in spite of the immense disproportion in their respective
resources; when not only the bravest soldiers of Asia, but the best
generals of Greece, had miserably failed in their attacks on the
frontier of the Delta, Phoenicia and Syria began to think whether what
was possible in Africa might not also be possible in Asia. From that
time forward, whenever a satrap or vassal prince meditated revolt, it
was to Egypt that he turned as a natural ally, and from Egypt he sought
the means to carry out his project; however needy the Pharaoh of that
day might be, he was always able to procure for such a suitor sufficient
money, munitions of war, ships, and men to enable him to make war
against the empire. The attempt made by Ochus failed, as all previous
attempts had done: the two adventurers who commanded the forces of
Nectanebo, the Athenian Diophantes and Lamius of Sparta, inflicted a
disastrous defeat on the imperial troops, and forced them to beat a
hasty retreat. This defeat was all the more serious in its consequences
because of the magnitude of the efforts which had been made: the king
himself was in command of the troops, and had been obliged to turn his
back precipitately on the foe. The Syrian provinces, which had been in
an unsettled condition ever since the invasion under Tachôs, flew to
arms; nine petty kings of Cyprus, including Evagoras II., nephew of the
famous prince of that name, refused to pay tribute, and Artabazus
roused Asia Minor to rebellion. The Phoenicians still hesitated; but
the insolence of their satrap, the rapacity of the generals who had
been repulsed from Egypt, and the lack of discipline in the Persian
army forced them to a decision. In a convention summoned at Tripoli, the
representatives of the Phoenician cities conferred on Tennes, King
of Sidon, the perilous honour of conducting the operations of the
confederate army, and his first act was to destroy the royal villa
in the Lebanon, and his next to burn the provisions which had been
accumulated in various ports in view of the Egyptian war (351-350 B.C.).

<p>
Ochus imagined at the outset that his generals would soon suppress these
rebellions, and, in fact, Idrieus, tyrant of Caria, supported by eight
thousand mercenaries under the Athenian Phocion, overcame the petty
tyrants of Cyprus without much difficulty; but in Asia Minor, Artabazus,
supported by Athens and Thebes, held at bay the generals sent to oppose
him, and Tennes won a signal victory in Syria. He turned for support
to Egypt, and Nectanebo, as might be expected, put Greek troops at his
disposal to the number of four thousand, commanded by one of his best
generals, Mentor of Ehodes: Belesys, the satrap of Syria, and Mazseus,
satrap of Cilicia, suffered a total defeat. Ochus, exasperated at their
want of success, called out every available soldier, three hundred
thousand Asiatics and ten thousand Greeks; the Sidonians, on their side,
dug a triple trench round their city, raised their ramparts, and set
fire to their ships, to demonstrate their intention of holding out
to the end. Unfortunately, their king, Tennes, was not a man of firm
resolution. Hitherto he had lived a life of self-indulgence, surrounded
by the women of his harem, whom he had purchased at great cost in Ionia
and Greece, and had made it the chief object of his ambition to surpass
in magnificence the most ostentatious princes of Cyprus, especially
Nicocles of Salamis, son of Evagoras. The approach of Ochus confused
his scanty wits; he endeavoured to wipe out his treachery towards his
suzerain by the betrayal of his own subjects. He secretly despatched
his confidential minister, a certain Thessalion, to the Persian camp,
promising to betray Sidon to the Persian king, and to act as his guide
into Egypt on condition of having his life preserved and his royal rank
guaranteed to him. Ochus had already agreed to these conditions, when
an impulse of vanity on his part nearly ruined the whole arrangement.
Thessalion, not unreasonably doubting the king's good faith, had
demanded that he should swear by his right hand to fulfil to the letter
all the clauses of the treaty; whereupon Ochus, whose dignity was
offended by this insistence, gave orders for the execution of the
ambassador. But as the latter was being dragged away, he cried out that
the king could do as he liked, but that if he disdained the help of
Tennes, he would fail in his attacks both upon Phonicia and Egypt. These
words produced a sudden reaction, and Thessalion obtained all that he
demanded. When the Persians had arrived within a few days' march of
Sidon, Tennes proclaimed that a general assembly of the Phoenician
deputies was to be held, and under pretext of escorting the hundred
leading men of his city to the appointed place of meeting, led them into
the enemy's camp, where they were promptly despatched by the javelins of
the soldiery. The Sidonians, deserted by their king, were determined
to carry on the struggle, in the expectation of receiving succour from
Egypt; but the Persian darics had already found their way into the hands
of the mercenary troops, and the general whom Nectanebo had lent them,
declared that his men considered the position desperate, and that he
should surrender the city at the first summons. The Sidonians thereupon
found themselves reduced to the necessity of imploring the mercy of the
conqueror, and five hundred of them set out to meet him as suppliants,
carrying olive branches in their hands. Bub Ochus was the most cruel
monarch who had ever reigned in Persia&mdash;the only one, perhaps, who was
really bloodthirsty by nature; he refused to listen to the entreaties of
the suppliants, and, like the preceding hundred delegates, they were all
slain. The remaining citizens, perceiving that they could not hope for
pardon, barricaded themselves in their houses, to which they set fire
with their own hands; forty thousand persons perished in the flames, and
so great was the luxury in the appointments of the private houses,
that large sums were paid for the right to dig for the gold and silver
ornaments buried in the ruins. The destruction of the city was almost as
complete as in the days of Esarhaddon. When Sidon had thus met her fate,
the Persians had no further reason for sparing its king, Tennes, and he
was delivered to the executioner; whereupon the other Phoenician kings,
terrified by his fate, opened their gates without a struggle.
</p>
<p>
Once more the treachery of a few traitors had disconcerted the plans of
the Pharaoh, and delivered the outposts of Egypt into the hands of the
enemy: but Ochus renewed his preparations with marvellous tenacity, and
resolved to neglect nothing which might contribute to his final success.
His victories had confirmed the cities of the empire in their loyalty,
and they vied with one another in endeavouring to win oblivion for their
former hesitation by their present zeal: "What city, or what nation of
Asia did not send embassies to the sovereign? what wealth did they not
lavish on him, whether the natural products of the soil, or the rare and
precious productions of art? Did he not receive a quantity of tapestry
and woven hangings, some of purple, some of diverse colours, others of
pure white? many gilded pavilions, completely furnished, and containing
an abundant supply of linen and sumptuous beds? chased silver, wrought
gold, cups and bowls, enriched with precious stones, or valuable for the
perfection and richness of their work? He also received untold supplies
of barbarian and Grecian weapons, and still larger numbers of draught
cattle and of sacrificial victims, bushels of preserved fruits, bales
and sacks full of parchments or books, and all kinds of useful articles?
So great was the quantity of salted meats which poured in from all
sides, that from a distance the piles might readily be mistaken for
rows of hillocks or high mounds." The land-force was divided into three
corps, each under a barbarian and a Greek general. It advanced along
the sea coast, following the ancient route pursued by the armies of the
Pharaohs, and as it skirted the marshes of Sirbonis, some detachments,
having imprudently ventured over the treacherous soil, perished to a
man. When the main force arrived in safety before Pelusium, it found
Nectanebo awaiting it behind his ramparts and marshes. He had fewer men
than his adversary, his force numbering only six thousand Egyptians,
twenty thousand Libyans, and the same number of Greeks; but the
remembrance of the successes won by himself and his predecessors with
inferior numbers inspired him with confidence in the issue of the
struggle. His fleet could not have ventured to meet in battle the
combined squadrons of Cyprus and Phoenicia, but, on the other hand, he
had a sufficient number of flat-bottomed boats to prevent any adversary
from entering the mouths of the Nile. The weak points along his
Mediterranean seaboard and eastern frontier were covered by strongholds,
fortifications, and entrenched camps: in short, his plans were
sufficiently well laid to ensure success in a defensive war, if the
rash ardour of his Greek mercenaries had not defeated his plans. Five
thousand of these troops were in occupation of Pelusium, under command
of Philophrôn. Some companies of Thebans, who were serving under
Lacrates in the Persian army, crossed a deep canal which separated them
from the city, and provoked the garrison to risk an encounter in
the open field. Philophrôn, instead of treating their challenge with
indifference, accepted it, and engaged in a combat which lasted till
nightfall. On the following day, Lacrates, having drawn off the waters
of the canal and thrown a dyke across it, led his entire force up to the
glacis of the fortifications, dug some trenches, and brought up a
line of battering-rams. He would soon have effected a breach, but the
Egyptians understood how to use the spade as well as the lance, and
while the outer wall was crumbling, they improvised behind it a second
wall, crowned with wooden turrets. Nectanebo, who had come up with
thirty thousand native, five thousand Greek troops, and half the
Libyan contingent, observed the vicissitudes of the siege from a short
distance, and by his presence alone opposed the advance of the bulk
of the Persian army. Weeks passed by, the time of the inundation was
approaching, and it seemed as if this policy of delay would have its
accustomed success, when an unforeseen incident decided in a moment the
fate of Egypt. Among the officers of Ochus was a certain Nicostratus of
Argos, who on account of his prodigious strength was often compared to
Heracles, and who out of vanity dressed himself up in the traditional
costume of that hero, the lion's skin and the club. Having imbibed,
doubtless, the ideas formerly propounded by Iphicrates, Nicostratus
forced some peasants, whose wives and children he had seized as
hostages, to act as his guides, and made his way up one of the canals
which traverse the marshes of Menzaleh: there he disembarked his men in
the rear of Nectanebo, and took up a very strong position on the
border of the cultivated land. This enterprise, undertaken with a very
insufficient force, was an extremely rash one; if the Egyptian generals
had contented themselves with harassing Nicostratus without venturing on
engaging him in a pitched battle, they would speedily have forced him to
re-embark or to lay down his arms. Unfortunately, however, five thousand
mercenaries, who formed the garrison of one of the neighbouring towns,
hastened to attack him under the command of Clinias of Cos, and suffered
a severe defeat. As a result, the gates of the town were thrown open
to the enemy, and if the Persians, encouraged by the success of this
forlorn hope, had followed it up boldly, Nectanebo would have run the
risk of being cut off from his troops which were around Pelusium, and of
being subsequently crushed. He thought it wiser to retreat towards the
apex of the Delta, but this very act of prudence exposed him to one of
those accidental misfortunes which are wont to occur in armies formed
of very diverse elements. While he was concentrating his reserves at
Memphis, the troops of the first line thought that, by leaving
them exposed to the assaults of the great king, he was deliberately
sacrificing them. Pelusium capitulated to Lacrates; Mentor of Ehodes
pushed forward and seized Bubastis, and the other cities in the eastern
portion of the Delta, fearing to bring upon themselves the fate
of Sidon, opened their gates to the Persians after a mere show of
resistance. The forces which had collected at Memphis thereupon
disbanded, and Nectanebo, ruined by these successive disasters,
collected his treasures and fled to Ethiopia. The successful issue of
the rash enterprise of Nicostratus had overthrown the empire of the
Pharaohs, and re-established the Persian empire in its integrity (342
B.C.).*

     Siculus, who generally follows the narrative of Theopompus.
     The chronology is still sufficiently uncertain to leave some
     doubt as to the exact date of each event; I have followed
     that arrangement which seems to accord best with the general
     history of the period. The following table may be drawn up
     of the last Egyptian dynasties as far as they can be

Egypt had prospered under the strong rule of its last native Pharaohs.
Every one of them, from Amyrtous down to Nectanebo, had done his best
to efface all traces of the Persian invasions and restore to the country
the appearance which it had presented before the days of its servitude;
even kings like Psamutis and Tachôs, whose reign had been of the
briefest, had, like those who ruled for longer periods, constructed or
beautified the monuments of the country. The Thebaid was in this respect
a special field of their labours. The island of Philæ, exposed to the
ceaseless attacks of the Ethiopians, had been reduced to little more
than a pile of ruins.

Nectanebo II. erected a magnificent gate there, afterwards incorporated
into the first pylon of the temple built by the Ptolemies, and one
at least of the buildings that still remain, the charming rectangular
kiosk, the pillars of which, with their Hathor capitals, rise above
the southern extremity of the island and mark the spot at which the
Ethiopian pilgrims first set foot on the sacred territory of the
bountiful Isis. Nectanebo I. restored the sanctuaries of Nekhabît at
El-Kab, and of Horus at Edfu, in which latter place he has left an
admirable naos which delights the modern traveller by its severe
proportions and simplicity of ornament, while Nectanebo II. repaired the
ancient temple of Mînu at Coptos; in short, without giving a detailed
list of what was accomplished by each of these later Pharaohs, it may be
said that there are few important sites in the valley of the Nile where
some striking evidence of their activity may not still be discovered
even after the lapse of so many centuries.

Moreover, in spite of the brief space of time within which they were
carried out, the majority of these works betray no signs of haste
or slipshod execution; the craftsmen employed on them seem to have
preserved in their full integrity all the artistic traditions of earlier
times, and were capable of producing masterpieces which will bear
comparison with those of the golden age. The Eastern gate, erected at
Karnak in the time of Nectanebo II., is in no way inferior either in
purity of proportion or in the beauty of its carvings to what remains of
the gates of Amenôthes III.
</p>


<p>
The sarcophagus of Nectanebo I. is carved and decorated with a
perfection of skill which had never been surpassed in any age, and
elsewhere, on all the monuments which bear the name of this monarch the
hieroglyphics have been designed and carved with as much care as though
each one of them had been a precious cameo.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The sarcophagus was for a long time preserved near the
     mosque of Ibn-Tulun, and was credited with peculiar virtues
     by the superstitious inhabitants of Cairo.
</pre>
<p>
The basalt torso of Nectanebo II., which attracts so much admiration
in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris for accuracy of proportion and
delicacy of modelling, deserves to rank with the finest statues of the
ancient empire. The men's heads are veritable portraits, in which such
details as a peculiar conformation of the skull, prominent cheekbones,
deep-set eyes, sunken cheeks, or the modelling of the chin, have all
been observed and reproduced with a fidelity and keenness of observation
which we fail to find in such works of the earlier artists as have come
down to us. These later sculptors display the same regard for truth in
their treatment of animals, and their dog-headed divinities; their dogs,
lions, and sphinxes will safely bear comparison with the most lifelike
presentments of these creatures to be found among the remains of the
Memphite or Theban eras. Egypt was thus in the full tide of material
prosperity when it again fell under the Persian yoke, and might have
become a source of inexhaustible wealth to Ochus had he known how to
secure acceptance of his rule, as Darius, son of Hystaspes, had done in
the days of Amasis.

The violence of his temperament, however, impelled him to a course of
pitiless oppression, and his favourite minister, the eunuch Bagoas,
seems to have done his best to stimulate his master's natural cruelty.
In the days when they felt themselves securely protected from his anger
by their Libyan and Greek troops, the fellahîn had freely indulged in
lampoons at the expense of their Persian suzerain; they had compared him
to Typhon on account of his barbarity, and had nicknamed him "the Ass,"
this animal being in their eyes a type of everything that is vile.
On his arrival at Memphis, Ochus gave orders that an ass should be
installed in the temple of Phtah, and have divine honours paid to it; he
next had the bull Apis slaughtered and served up at a set banquet which
he gave to his friends on taking possession of the White Wall. The
sacred goat of Mendes suffered the same fate as the Apis, and doubtless
none of the other sacred animals were spared. Bagoas looted the temples
in the most systematic way, despatched the sacred books to Persia, razed
the walls of the cities to the ground, and put every avowed partisan of
the native dynasty to the sword. After these punitive measures had been
carried out, Ochus disbanded his mercenaries and returned to Babylon,
leaving Pherendates in charge of the reconquered province.*
</p>
<pre>
     * It seems that a part of the atrocities committed by Ochus
     and Bagoas soon came to be referred to the time of the
     "Impure" and to that of Cambyses.

The downfall of Egypt struck terror into the rebellious satraps who were
in arms elsewhere. Artabazus, who had kept Asia Minor in a ferment ever
since the time of Artaxerxes II., gave up the struggle of his own accord
and took refuge in Macedonia. The petty kings of the cities on the
shores of the Hellespont and the Ægean submitted themselves in order to
regain favour, or if, like Hermias of Atarnasa, the friend of Aristotle,
they still resisted, they were taken prisoners and condemned to death.
The success of Ochus was a reality, but there was still much to be done
before things were restored to the footing they had occupied before the
crisis. We know enough of the course of events in the western provinces
to realise the pitch of weakness to which the imbecility of Darius II.
and his son Artaxerxes II. had reduced the empire of Darius and
Xerxes, but it is quite certain that the disastrous effects of their
misgovernment were not confined to the shores of the Mediterranean,
but were felt no less acutely in the eastern and central regions of the
empire. There, as on the Greek frontiers, the system built up at the
cost of so much ingenuity by Darius was gradually being broken down with
each year that passed, and the central government could no longer
make its power felt at the extremities of the empire save at irregular
intervals, when its mandates were not intercepted or nullified in
transmission. The functions of the "Eyes" and "Ears" of the king had
degenerated into a mere meaningless formality, and were, more often
than not, dispensed with altogether. The line of demarcation between
the military and civil power had been obliterated: not only had the
originally independent offices of satrap, general, and secretary ceased
to exist in each separate province, but, in many instances, the satrap,
after usurping the functions of his two colleagues, contrived to extend
his jurisdiction till it included several provinces, thus establishing
himself as a kind of viceroy. Absorbed in disputes among themselves, or
in conspiracies against the Achsemenian dynasty, these officials had no
time to look after the well-being of the districts under their control,
and the various tribes and cities took advantage of this to break the
ties of vassalage. To take Asia Minor alone, some of the petty kings
of Bithynia, Paphlagonia, and certain districts of Cappadocia or the
mountainous parts of Phrygia still paid their tribute intermittently,
and only when compelled to do so; others, however, such as the
Pisidians, Lycaonians, a part of the Lycians, and some races of Mount
Taurus, no longer dreamed of doing so. The three satrapies on the shores
of the Caspian, which a hundred years before had wedged themselves in
between that sea and the Euxine, were now dissolved, all trace of them
being lost in a confused medley of kingdoms and small states, some of
which were ready enough to acknowledge the supremacy of Persia, while
others, such as the Gordiseans, Taochi, Chalybes, Colchi, Mosynoki, and
Tibarenians, obeyed no rule but their own.

All along the Caspian, the Cadusians and Amardians, on either side of
the chain of mountains bordering the Iranian plateau, defied all the
efforts made to subdue them.* India and the Sakse had developed from
the condition of subjects into that of friendly allies, and the
savage hordes of Gedrosia and the Paropamisus refused to recognise any
authority at all.**

     * They appear in the history of every epoch as the
     irreconcilable foes of the great king, enemies against whom
     even the most peacefully disposed sovereigns were compelled

     ** The Sakæ fought at Arbela, but only as allies of the
     Persians. The Indians who are mentioned with them came from
     the neighbourhood of Cabul; most of the races who had
     formerly figured in Darius' satrapy of India had become
     independent by the time Alexander penetrated into the basin
     of the Indus.

The whole empire needed to be reconquered and reorganised bit by bit if
it was to exercise that influence in the world to which its immense size
entitled it, and the question arose whether the elements of which it
consisted would lend themselves to any permanent reorganisation or
readjustment.

The races of the ancient Eastern world, or, at any rate, that portion of
them which helped to make its history, either existed no longer or had
sunk into their dotage. They had worn each other out in the centuries
of their prime, Chaldæans and Assyrians fighting against Cossæans or
Elamites, Egyptians against Ethiopians and against Hittites, Urartians,
Armæans, the peoples of Lebanon and of Damascus, the Phoenicians,
Canaanites and Jews, until at last, with impoverished blood and flagging
energies, they were thrown into conflict with younger and more vigorous
nations. The Medes had swept away all that still remained of Assyria
and Urartu; the Persians had overthrown the Medes, the Lydians, and the
Chaldæans, till Egypt alone remained and was struck down by them in her
turn. What had become of these conquered nations during the period
of nearly two hundred years that the Achæmenians had ruled over them?
First, as regards Elam, one of the oldest and formerly the most powerful
of them all. She had been rent into two halves, each of them destined
to have a different fate. In the mountains, the Uxians, Mardians,
Elymasans, and Cossæans&mdash;tribes who had formerly been the backbone of
the nation&mdash;had relapsed into a semi-barbarous condition, or rather,
while the rest of the world had progressed in civilization and
refinement, they had remained in a state of stagnation, adhering
obstinately to the customs of their palmy days: just as they had harried
the Chaldæans or Assyrians in the olden times, so now they harried the
Persians; then, taking refuge in their rocky fastnesses, they lived on
the proceeds of their forays, successfully resisting all attempts made
to dislodge them. The people of the plains, on the other hand, kept in
check from the outset by the presence of the court at Susa, not only
promptly resigned themselves to their fate, but even took pleasure in
it, and came to look upon themselves as in some sort the masters of
Asia. Was it not to their country, to the very spot occupied by the
palace of their king, that, for nearly two hundred years, satraps,
vassal kings, the legates of foreign races, ambassadors of Greek
republics&mdash;in a word, all the great ones of this world&mdash;came every year
to render homage, and had not the treasures which these visitors brought
with them been expended, in part at any rate, on their country? The
memory of their former prosperity paled before the splendours of their
new destiny, and the glory of their ancestors suffered eclipse. The
names of the national kings, the story of their Chaldæan and Syrian
conquests, the trophies of their victories over the great generals
of Nineveh, the horrors of their latest discords and of the final
catastrophe were all forgotten; even the documents which might have
helped to recall them lay buried in the heart of the mound which served
as a foundation for the palace of the Achgernenides. Beyond the vague
consciousness of a splendid past, the memory of the common people was
a blank, and when questioned by strangers they could tell them nothing
save legends of the gods or the exploits of mythical heroes; and from
them the Greeks borrowed their Memnon, that son of Tithonus and Eôs
who rushed to the aid of Priam with his band of Ethiopians, and whose
prowess had failed to retard by a single day the downfall of Troy.
Further northwards, the Urartians and peoples of ancient Naîri, less
favoured by fortune, lost ground with each successive generation,
yielding to the steady pressure of the Armenians. In the time of
Herodotus they were still in possession of the upper basins of the
Euphrates and Araxus, and, in conjunction with the Matieni and Saspires,
formed a satrapy&mdash;the eighteenth&mdash;the boundaries of which coincided
pretty closely with those of the kingdom ruled over by the last kings
of Van in the days of Assur-bani-pal; the Armenians, on their side,
constituted the thirteenth satrapy, between Mount Taurus and the Lower
Arsanias.

<p>
The whole face of their country had undergone a profound change since
that time: the Urartians, driven northwards, became intermingled with
the tribes on the slopes of the Caucasus, while the Armenians, carried
along towards the east, as though by some resistless current, were
now scaling the mountainous bulwark of Ararat, and slowly but surely
encroaching on the lower plains of the Araxes. These political
changes had been almost completed by the time of Ochus, and Urartu had
disappeared from the scene, but an Armenia now flourished in the very
region where Urartu had once ruled, and its princes, who were related
to the family of the Achæmenides, wielded an authority little short of
regal under the modest name of satraps. Thanks to their influence, the
religions and customs of Iran were introduced into the eastern borders
of Asia Minor. They made their way into the valleys of the Iris and the
Halys, into Cappadocia and the country round Mount Taurus, and thither
they brought with them the official script of the empire, the Persian
and Aramaean cuneiform which was employed in public documents, in
inscriptions, and on coins. The centre of the peninsula remained very
much the same as it had been in the period of the Phrygian supremacy,
but further westward Hellenic influences gradually made themselves felt.
</p>

<p>
The arts of Greece, its manners, religious ideals, and modes of thought,
were slowly displacing civilisations of the Asianic type, and even in
places like Lycia, where the language successfully withstood the Greek
invasion, the life of the nations, and especially of their rulers,
became so deeply impregnated with Hellenism as to differ but little from
that in the cities on the Ionic, Æolian, or Doric seaboard. The Lycians
still adhered to the ancient forms which characterised their funerary
architecture, but it was to Greek sculptors, or pupils from the Grecian
schools, that they entrusted the decoration of the sides of their
sarcophagi and of their tombs.
</p>



<p>
Their kings minted coins many of which are reckoned among the
masterpieces of antique engraving; and if we pass from Lycia to the
petty states of Caria, we come upon one of the greatest triumphs of
Greek art&mdash;that huge mausoleum in which the inconsolable Artemisia
enclosed the ashes and erected the statue of her husband. The Asia Minor
of Egyptian times, with its old-world dynasties, its old-world names,
and old-world races, had come to be nothing more than an historic
memory; even that martial world, in which the Assyrian conquerors fought
so many battles from the Euphrates to the Black Sea, was now no more,
and its neighbours and enemies of former days had, for the most part,
disappeared from the land of the living.

The Lotanu were gone, the Khâti were gone, and gone, too, were
Carchemish, Arpad, and Qodshu, much of th§ir domain having been
swallowed up again by the desert for want of hands to water and till it;
even Assyria itself seemed but a shadow half shrouded in the mists of
oblivion. Sangara, Nisibis, Resaina, and Edessa still showed some signs
of vigour, but on quitting the slopes of the Masios and proceeding
southwards, piles of ruins alone marked the sites of those wealthy
cities through which the Ninevite monarchs had passed in their
journeyings towards Syria. Here wide tracts of arid and treeless
country were now to be seen covered with aromatic herbage, where the
Scenite Arabs were wont to pursue the lion, wild ass, ostrich, bustard,
antelope, and gazelle; a few abandoned forts, such as Korsortê, Anatho,
and Is (Hit) marked the halting-places of armies on the banks of the
Euphrates. In the region of the Tigris, the descendants of Assyrian
captives who, like the Jews, had been set free by Cyrus, had rebuilt
Assur, and had there grown wealthy by husbandry and commerce,* but in
the district of the Zab solitude reigned supreme.** Calah and Nineveh
were alike deserted, and though their ruins still littered the sites
where they had stood, their names were unknown in the neighbouring
villages. Xenophon, relying on his guides, calls the former place
Larissa, the second Mespila.***
</p>
<pre>
     * This seems to be indicated by a mutilated passage in the
     <i>Cylinder of Gyrus</i>, where Assur is mentioned in the list of
     towns and countries whose inhabitants were sent back to
     their homes by Cyrus after the capture of Babylon. Xenophon
     calls it Esense, this being, possibly, a translation of the
     name given to it by its inhabitants. Nothing could be more
     natural than for exiles to call the villages founded by them
     on their return "new." The town seems to have been a large
     and wealthy one.

     ** Xenophon calls this country Media, a desert region which
     the Ten Thousand took six days to cross.

     *** The name Larissa is, possibly, a corruption of some name
     similar to that of the city of Larsam in Chaldæa; Mespila
     may be a generic term. [Mespila is Muspula, "the low ground"
     at the foot of Kouyunjik; Larissa probably Al Resen or
     Res-eni, between Kouyunjik and Nebi Yunus.&mdash;Ed.]

Already there were historians who took the ziggurât at Nineveh to be
the burial-place of Sardanapalus. They declared that Cyrus had pulled it
down in order to strengthen his camp during the siege of the town, and
that formerly it had borne an epitaph afterwards put into verse by the
poet Choerilus of Iassus: "I reigned, and so long as I beheld the light
of the sun, I ate, I drank, I loved, well knowing how brief is the
life of man, and to how many vicissitudes it is liable." Many writers,
remembering the Assyrian monument at Anchialê in Cilicia, were inclined
to place the king's tomb there. It was surmounted by the statue of a
man&mdash;according to one account, with his hands crossed upon his breast,
according to another, in the act of snapping his fingers&mdash;and bore the
following inscription in Chaldaic letters: "I, Sardanapalus, son of
Anakyndaraxes, founded Anchialê and Tarsus in one day, but now am dead."
Thus ten centuries of conquests and massacre had passed away like a
vapour, leaving nothing but a meagre residue of old men's tales and
moral axioms.
</p>
<p>
In one respect only does the civilisation of the Euphrates seem to have
fairly held its own. Cossæa, though it had lost its independence, had
lost but little of its wealth; its former rebellions had done it no
great injury, and its ancient cities were still left standing, though
shorn of their early splendour. Uru, it is true, numbered but few
citizens round its tottering sanctuaries, but Uruk maintained a school
of theologians and astronomers no less famous throughout the East than
those of Borsippa. The swamps, however, which surrounded it possessed
few attractions, and Greek travellers rarely ventured thither. They
generally stopped at Babylon, or if they ventured off the beaten track,
it was only to visit the monuments of Nebuchadrezzar, or the tombs of
the early kings in its immediate neighbourhood. Babylon was, indeed, one
of the capitals of the empire&mdash;nay, for more than half a century, during
the closing years of Artaxerxes I., in the reign of Darius II., and
in the early days of Artaxerxes IL, it had been the real capital; even
under Ochus, the court spent the winter months there, and resorted
thither in quest of those resources of industry and commerce which Susa
lacked. The material benefits due to the presence of the sovereign seem
to have reconciled the city to its subject condition; there had been no
seditious movement there since the ill-starred rising of Shamasherîb,
which Xerxes had quelled with ruthless severity. The Greek mercenaries
or traders who visited it, though prepared for its huge size by general
report, could not repress a feeling of astonishment as they approached
it. First of all there was the triple wall of Nebuchadrezzar, with its
moats, its rows of towers, and its colossal gateways. Unlike the Greek
cities, it had been laid out according to a regular plan, and formed a
perfect square, inside which the streets crossed one another at right
angles, some parallel to the Euphrates, others at right angles to it;
every one of the latter terminated in a brazen gate opening through the
masonry of the quay, and giving access to the river. The passengers who
crowded the streets included representatives of all the Asiatic races,
the native Babylonians being recognisable by their graceful dress,
consisting of a linen tunic falling to the feet, a fringed shawl, round
cap, and heavy staff terminating in a knob. From this ever-changing
background stood out many novel features calculated to stimulate Greek
curiosity, such as the sick persons exposed at street-corners in
order that they might beg the passers-by to prescribe for them, the
prostitution of her votaries within the courts of the goddess Mylitta,
and the disposal of marriageable girls by auction: Herodotus, however,
regretted that this latter custom had fallen into abeyance. And yet to
the attentive eye of a close observer even Babylon must have furnished
many unmistakable symptoms of decay. The huge boundary wall enclosed
too large an area for the population sheltered behind it; whole quarters
were crumbling into heaps of ruins, and the flower and vegetable gardens
were steadily encroaching on spaces formerly covered with houses. Public
buildings had suffered quite as much as private dwellings from the
Persian wars. Xerxes had despoiled the temples, and no restoration
had been attempted since his time. The ziggurât of Bel lay half buried
already beneath piles of rubbish; the golden statues which had once
stood within its chambers had disappeared, and the priests no longer
carried on their astronomical observations on its platform.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus merely mentions that Xerxes had despoiled the
     temple; Strabo tells us that Alexander wished to restore it,
     but that it was in such a state of dilapidation that it
     would have taken ten thousand men two months merely to
     remove the rubbish.

<p>
The palaces of the ancient kings were falling to pieces from lack of
repairs, though the famous hanging gardens in the citadel were still
shown to strangers. The guides, of course, gave them out to be a device
of Semiramis, but the well-informed knew that they had been constructed
by Nebuchadrezzar for one of his wives the daughter of Oyaxares, who
pined for the verdure of her native mountains. "They were square in
shape, each side being four hundred feet long; one approached them by
steps leading to terraces placed one above the other, the arrangement
of the whole, resembling that of an amphitheatre. Each terrace rested on
pillars which, gradually increasing in size, supported the weight of
the soil and its produce. The loftiest pillar attained a height of fifty
feet; it reached to the upper part of the garden, its capital being on
a level with the balustrades of the boundary wall. The terraces were
covered with a layer of soil of sufficient depth for the roots of the
largest trees; plants of all kinds that delight the eye by their shape
or beauty were grown there. One of the columns was hollowed from top
to bottom; it contained hydraulic engines which pumped up quantities of
water, no part of the mechanism being visible from the outside."
Many travellers were content to note down only such marvels as they
considered likely to make their narratives more amusing, but others took
pains to collect information of a more solid character, and before
they had carried their researches very far, were at once astounded and
delighted with the glimpses they obtained of Chaldæan genius. No doubt,
they exaggerated when they went so far as to maintain that all their
learning came to them originally from Babylon, and that the most famous
scholars of Greece, Pherecydes of Scyros, Democritus of Abdera, and
Pythagoras,* owed the rudiments of philosophy, mathematics, physics, and
astrology to the school of the <i>Magi</i>.
</p>
<pre>
     * The story which asserts that Pythagoras served under
     Nergilos, King of Assyria, is probably based on some
     similarity of names: thus among the Greek kings of Cyprus,
     and in the time of Assur-bani-pal, we find one whose name
     would recall that of Pythagoras, if the accuracy of the
     reading were beyond question.
</pre>
<p>
Yet it is not surprising that they should have believed this to be the
case, when increasing familiarity with the priestly seminaries revealed
to them the existence of those libraries of clay tablets in which, side
by side with theoretic treatises dating from two thousand years back
and more, were to be found examples of applied mechanics, observations,
reckonings, and novel solutions of problems, which generations
of scribes had accumulated in the course of centuries. The Greek
astronomers took full advantage of these documents, but it was their
astrologers and soothsayers who were specially indebted to them. The
latter acknowledged their own inferiority the moment they came into
contact with their Euphratean colleagues, and endeavoured to make good
their deficiencies by taking lessons from the latter or persuading them
to migrate to Greece. A hundred years later saw the Babylonian Berosus
opening at Cos a public school of divination by the stars. From
thenceforward "Chaldæan" came to be synonymous with "astrologer" or
"sorcerer," and Chaldæan magic became supreme throughout the world at
the very moment when Chaldæa itself was in its death-throes.
</p>
<p>
Nor was its unquestioned supremacy in the black art the sole legacy that
Chaldæa bequeathed to the coming generations: its language survived, and
reigned for centuries afterwards in the regions subjugated by its arms.
The cultivated tongue employed by the scribes of Nineve and Babylon
in the palmy days of their race, had long become a sort of literary
dialect, used in writings of a lofty character and understood by a
select few, but unintelligible to the common people. The populace in
town or country talked an Aramaic jargon, clumsier and more prolix
than Assyrian, but easier to understand. We know how successfully the
Aramæans had managed to push their way along the Euphrates and into
Syria towards the close of the Hittite supremacy: their successive
encroachments had been favoured, first by the Assyrian, later by the
Chaldæan conquests, and now they had become sole possessors of the
ancient Naharaîna, the plains of Cilicia, the basin of the Orontes, and
the country round Damascus; but the true home of the Aramæans was in
Syria rather than in the districts of the Lower Euphrates. Even in the
time of the Sargonids their alphabet had made so much headway that at
Nineveh itself and at Calah it had come into everyday use; when Chaldæan
supremacy gave way to that of the Persians, its triumph&mdash;in the western
provinces, at any rate&mdash;was complete, and it became the recognised
vehicle of the royal decrees: we come upon it in every direction, on
the coins issued by the satraps of Asia Minor, on the seals of local
governors or dynasts, on inscriptions or stelæ in Egypt, in the letters
of the scribes, and in the rescripts of the great king. From Nisib
to Baphia, between the Tigris and the Mediterranean, it gradually
supplanted most of the other dialects&mdash;Semitic or otherwise&mdash;which had
hitherto prevailed. Phoenician held its ground in the seaports, but
Hebrew gave way before it, and ended by being restricted to religious
purposes, as a literary and liturgical language. It was in the
neighbourhood of Babylon itself that the Judæan exiles had, during the
Captivity, adopted the Aramaic language, and their return to Canaan
failed to restore either the purity of their own language or the dignity
and independence of their religious life. Their colony at Jerusalem
possessed few resources; the wealthier Hebrews had, for the most part,
remained in Chaldæa, leaving the privilege of repopulating the holy city
to those of their brethren who were less plenteously endowed with this
world's goods. These latter soon learned to their cost that Zion was not
the ideal city whose "gates shall be open continually; they shall not
be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the wealth of
the nations;" far from "sucking the milk of nations and the breast of
kings,"* their fields produced barely sufficient to satisfy the more
pressing needs of daily life. "Ye have sown much, and bring in little,"
as Jahveh declared to them "ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink,
but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none
warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with
holes."**

<p>
They quickly relinquished the work of restoration, finding themselves
forgotten by all&mdash;their Babylonian brethren included&mdash;in the midst of
the great events which were then agitating the world, the preparations
for the conquest of Egypt, the usurpation of the pseudo-Smerdis, the
accession of Darius, the Babylonian and Median insurrections. Possibly
they believed that the Achæmenides had had their day, and that a new
Chaldæan empire, with a second Nebuchadrezzar at its head, was about to
regain the ascendency. It would seem that the downfall of Nadintav-bel
inspired them with new faith in the future and encouraged them to
complete their task: in the second year of Darius, two prophets, Haggai
and Zechariah, arose in their midst and lifted up their voices.
</p>



<p>
Zerubbabel, a prince of the royal line, governed Judah in the Persian
interest, and with him was associated the high priest Joshua, who looked
after the spiritual interests of the community: the reproaches of the
two prophets aroused the people from their inaction, and induced them to
resume their interrupted building operations. Darius, duly informed of
what was going on by the governor of Syria, gave orders that they were
not to be interfered with, and four years later the building of the
temple was completed.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Ezra iv.-vi.; the account given by Josephus of the two
     expeditions of Zerubbabel seems to have been borrowed partly
     from the canonical book, partly from the Apocryphal writing
     known as the <i>1st Book of Esdras</i>.
</pre>
<p>
For nearly a century after this the little Jewish republic remained
quiescent. It had slowly developed until it had gradually won back
a portion of the former territories of Benjamin and Judah, but its
expansion southwards was checked by the Idumæans, to whom Nebuchadrezzar
had years before handed over Hebron and Acrabattenê (Akrabbim) as a
reward for the services they had rendered.
</p>
<p>
On the north its neighbours were the descendants of those Aramaean
exiles whom Sargon, Sennacherib, and Esar-haddon, kings of Assyria,
had, on various occasions, installed around Samaria in Mount Ephraim. At
first these people paid no reverence to the "God of the land," so that
Jahveh, in order to punish them, sent lions, which spread carnage in
their ranks. Then the King of Assyria allotted them an Israelitish
priest from among his prisoners, who taught them "the law" of Jahveh,
and appointed other priests chosen from the people, and showed them how
to offer up sacrifices on the ancient high places.*

Thus another Israel began to rise up again, and, at first, the new
Judah seems to have been on tolerably friendly terms with it: the two
communities traded and intermarried with one another, the Samaritans
took part in the religious ceremonies, and certain of their leaders
occupied a court in the temple at Jerusalem. The alliance, however,
proved dangerous to the purity of the faith, for the proselytes, while
they adopted Jahveh and gave Him that supreme place in their devotions
which was due to "the God of the land," had by no means entirely
forsworn their national superstitions, and Adrammelek, Nergal, Tartak,
Anammelek, and other deities still found worshippers among them. Judah,
which in the days of its independence had so often turned aside after
the gods of Canaan and Moab, was in danger of being led away by the
idolatrous practices of its new neighbours; intermarriage with the
daughters of Moab and Ammon, of Philistia and Samaria, was producing
a gradual degeneracy: the national language was giving way before the
Aramaean; unless some one could be found to stem the tide of decadence
and help the people to remount the slope which they were descending,
the fate of Judah was certain. A prophet&mdash;the last of those whose
predictions have survived to our time&mdash;stood forth amid the general
laxity and called the people to account for their transgressions, in
the name of the Eternal, but his single voice, which seemed but a
feeble echo of the great prophets of former ages, did not meet with
a favourable hearing. Salvation came at length from the Jews outside
Judah, the naturalised citizens of Babylon, a well-informed and wealthy
body, occupying high places in the administration of the empire, and
sometimes in the favour of the sovereign also, yet possessed by an
ardent zeal for the religion of their fathers and a steadfast faith
in the vitality of their race. One of these, a certain Nehemiah, was
employed as cupbearer to Artaxerxes II. He was visited at Susa by some
men of Judah whose business had brought them to that city and inquired
of them how matters fared in Jerusalem. Hanani, one of his visitors,
replied that "the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the
province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem
also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire."
Nehemiah took advantage of a moment when the king seemed in a jovial
mood to describe the wretched state of his native land in moving terms:
he obtained leave to quit Susa and authority to administer the city in
which his fathers had dwelt.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Nehemiah i., ii.
</pre>
<p>
This took place in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, about 385 B.C.
Nehemiah at once made his way to Jerusalem with such escort as
befitted his dignity, and the news of his mission, and, apparently,
the sentiments of rigid orthodoxy professed by him from the beginning,
provoked the resentment of the neighbouring potentates against him:
Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite, chief of the Samaritans,
and Geshem the Bedâwin did their best to thwart him in the execution of
his plans. He baffled their intrigues by his promptitude in rebuilding
the walls, and when once he had rendered himself safe from any sudden
attack, he proceeded with the reforms which he deemed urgent. His tenure
of office lasted twelve years&mdash;from 384 to 373 B.C.&mdash;and during the
whole of that time he refused to accept any of the dues to which he was
entitled, and which his predecessors had received without scruple. Ever
since their return from exile, the common people had been impoverished
and paralysed by usury. The poor had been compelled to mortgage their
fields and their vineyards in order to pay the king's taxes; then, when
their land was gone, they had pledged their sons and their daughters;
the moneyed classes of the new Israel thus absorbed the property of
their poorer brethren, and reduced the latter to slavery. Nehemiah
called the usurers before him and severely rebuking them for their
covetousness, bade them surrender the interest and capital of existing
debts, and restore the properties which had fallen into their hands
owing to their shameful abuse of wealth, and release all those of their
co-religionists whom they had enslaved in default of payment of their
debts.* His high place in the royal favour doubtless had its effect
on those whose cupidity suffered from his zeal, and prevented external
enemies from too openly interfering in the affairs of the community:
by the time he returned to the court, in 372 B.C., after an absence of
twelve years, Jerusalem and its environs had to some extent regained
the material prosperity of former days. The part played by Nehemiah was,
however, mainly political, and the religious problem remained in very
much the same state as before. The high priests, who alone possessed the
power of solving it, had fallen in with the current that was carrying
away the people, and&mdash;latterly, at any rate&mdash;had become disqualified
through intermarriage with aliens: what was wanted was a scribe deeply
versed in sacred things to direct them in the right way, and such a man
could be found only in Babylonia, the one country in which the study of
the ancient traditions still flourished. A certain Ezra, son of Seraiah,
presented himself in 369 B.C., and, as he was a man of some standing,
Artaxerxes not only authorised him to go himself, but to take with him
a whole company of priests and Lévites and families formerly attached to
the service of the temple.** The books containing the Law of God and
the history of His people had, since the beginning of the captivity,
undergone alterations which had profoundly modified their text and
changed their spirit.

This work of revision, begun under the influence of Ezekiel, and perhaps
by his own followers, had, since his time, been carried on without
interruption, and by mingling the juridical texts with narratives of
the early ages collected from different sources, a lengthy work had been
produced, very similar in composition and wording to the five Books
of Moses and the Book of Joshua as we now possess them.* It was this
version of the Revelation of Jahveh that Ezra brought with him from
Babylon in order to instruct the people of Judah, and the first
impressions received by him at the end of his journey convinced him that
his task would be no light one, for the number of mixed marriages had
been so great as to demoralise not only the common people, but even
the priests and leading nobles as well. Nevertheless, at a general
assembly** of the people he succeeded in persuading them to consent to
the repudiation of alien wives.

But this preliminary success would have led to nothing unless he
could secure formal recognition of the rigorous code of which he had
constituted himself the champion, and protracted negotiations were
necessary before he could claim a victory on this point as well as
on the other. At length, about 367 B.C., more than a year after his
arrival, he gained his point, and the covenant between Jahveh and His
people was sealed with ceremonies modelled on those which had attended
the promulgation of Deuteronomy in the time of Josiah. On the first day
of the seventh month, a little before the autumn festival, the people
assembled at Jerusalem in "the broad place which was before the water
gate." Ezra mounted a wooden pulpit, and the chief among the priests sat
beside him. He "opened the book in the sight of all the people... and...
all the people stood up: and Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God.
And all the people answered 'Amen, amen!' with the lifting up of their
hands; and they bowed their heads and worshipped the Lord with their
faces to the ground." Then began the reading of the sacred text. As each
clause was read, the Lévites stationed here and there among the people
interpreted and explained its provisions in the vulgar tongue, so as
to make their meaning clear to all. The prolix enumeration of sins and
their expiation, and threats expressed in certain chapters, produced
among the crowd the same effect of nervous terror as had once before
been called forth by the precepts and maledictions of Deuteronomy. The
people burst into tears, and so vehement were their manifestations of
despair, that all the efforts of Ezra and his colleagues were needed to
calm them. Ezra took advantage of this state of fervour to demand the
immediate application of the divine ordinances. And first of all, it was
"found written in the law, how that the Lord had commanded by Moses
that the children of Israel should dwell in booths." For, seven days
Jerusalem was decked with leaves; tabernacles of olive, myrtle, and palm
branches rose up on all sides, on the roofs of houses, in courtyards,
in the courts of the temple, at the gates of the city. Then, on the 27th
day of the same month, the people put on mourning in order to confess
their own sins and the sins of their fathers. Finally, to crown the
whole, Ezra and his followers required the assembly to swear a solemn
oath that they would respect "the law of Moses," and regulate their
conduct by it.* After the first enthusiasm was passed, a reaction
speedily set in. Many even among the priests thought that Ezra had gone
too far in forbidding marriage with strangers, and that the increase of
the tithes and sacrifices would lay too heavy a burden on the nation.
The Gentile women reappeared, the Sabbath was no longer observed either
by the Israelites or aliens; Eliashîb, son of the high priest Joiakim,
did not even deprive Tobiah the Ammonite of the chamber in the
temple which he had formerly prepared for him, and things were
almost imperceptibly drifting back into the same state as before the
reformation, when Nehemiah returned from Susa towards the close of the
reign of Artaxerxes. He lost no time in re-establishing respect for the
law, and from henceforward opposition, if it did not entirely die out,
ceased to manifest itself in Jerusalem.**

Elsewhere, however, among the Samaritans, Indumæans, and Philistines, it
continued as keen as ever, and the Jews themselves were imprudent enough
to take part in the political revolutions that were happening around
them in their corner of the empire. Their traditions tell how they
were mixed up in the rising of the Phoenician cities against Ochus, and
suffered the penalty; when Sidon capitulated, they were punished with
the other rebels, the more recalcitrant among them being deported into
Hyrcania.
</p>
<p>
Assyria was nothing more than a name, Babylon and Phoenicia were growing
weaker every day; the Jews, absorbed in questions of religious ethics,
were deficient in material power, and had not as yet attained sufficient
moral authority to exercise an influence over the eastern world: the
Egypt indestructible had alone escaped the general shipwreck, and
seemed fated to survive her rivals for a long time. Of all these ancient
nations it was she who appealed most strongly to the imagination of the
Greeks: Greek traders, mercenaries, scholars, and even tourists wandered
freely within her borders, and accounts of the strange and marvellous
things to be found there were published far and wide in the writings
of Hecataeus of Miletus, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, and Hellanicus of
Lesbos. As a rule, they entered the country from the west, as European
tourists and merchants still do; but Eakôtis, the first port at which
they touched, was a mere village, and its rocky Pharos had no claim to
distinction beyond the fact that it had been mentioned by Homer.
From hence they followed the channel of the Canopic arm, and as
they gradually ascended, they had pointed out to them Anthylla,
Arkandrupolis, and Gyna> copolis, townships dependent on Naucratis,
lying along the banks, or situated some distance off on one of the minor
canals; then Naucratis itself, still a flourishing place, in spite
of the rebellions in the Delta and the suppressive measures of the
Persians. All this region seemed to them to be merely an extension of
Greece under the African sky: to their minds the real Egypt began at
Sais, a few miles further eastwards. Sais was full in memories of the
XXVIth dynasty; there they had pointed out to them the tombs of
the Pharaohs in the enclosure of Nit, the audience hall in which
Psammetichus II. received the deputation of the Eleians, the prison
where the unfortunate Apries had languished after his defeat. The
gateways of the temple of Nit seemed colossal to eyes accustomed to the
modest dimensions of most Greek sanctuaries; these were, moreover, the
first great monuments that the strangers had seen since they landed, and
the novelty of their appearance had a good deal to do with the keenness
of the impression produced. The goddess showed herself in hospitable
guise to the visitors; she welcomed them all, Greek or Persian, at her
festivals, and initiated them into several of her minor rites, without
demanding from them anything beyond tolerance on certain points of
doctrine.

Her dual attributes as wielder of the bow and shuttle had inspired the
Greeks with the belief that she was identical with that one of their own
goddesses who most nearly combined in her person this complex mingling
of war and industry: in her they Fountain and School of the Mother of

He made his way into the dwelling of the ineffable god, and there,
unobserved among the crowd, he witnessed scenes from the divine life
represented by the priests on the lake by the light of torches, episodes
of his passion, mourning, and resurrection. The priests did not disclose
their subtler mysteries before barbarian eyes, nor did they teach the
inner meaning of their dogmas, but the little they did allow him
to discern filled the traveller with respect and wonder, recalling
sometimes by their resemblance to them the mysteries in which he was
accustomed to take part in his own country. Then, as now, but little
attention was paid to the towns in the centre and east of the Delta;
travellers endeavoured to visit one or two of them as types, and
collected as much information as they could about the remainder.
Herodotus and his rivals attached little importance to those details of
landscape which possess so much attraction for the modern tourist. They
bestowed no more than a careless glance on the chapels scattered up and
down the country like the Mohammedan shrines at the present day, and the
waters extending on all sides beneath the acacias and palm trees during
the inundation, or the fellahin trotting along on their little asses
beside the pools, did not strike them as being of sufficient interest to
deserve passing mention in an account of their travels.

They passed by the most picturesque villages with indifference, and
it was only when they reached some great city, or came upon some
exceptionally fine temple or eccentric deity, that their curiosity was
aroused. Mendes worshipped its patron god in the form of a live ram,*
and bestowed on all members of the same species some share of the
veneration it lavished on the divine animal. The inhabitants of
Atarbêkhis,** on the island of Prosopitis, gave themselves up to the
worship of the bull.
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus says that both the goats and the god were named
     Mendes in Egyptian, but he is here confusing ordinary goats
     with the special goat which was supposed to contain the soul
     of Osiris. It was the latter that the Egyptians named after
     the god himself, Baînibdîduît, i.e. <i>the soul of the master
     of the city of Diduît</i>.

     ** The old explanation of this name as the <i>City of Hathor</i>
     has been rightly rejected as inconsistent with one of the
     elementary rules of hieroglyphic grammar. The name, when
     properly divided into its three constituent parts, means
     literally <i>the Castle of horus the Sparrow-hawk, or Hat-har-

When one of these animals died in the neighbourhood they buried it,
leaving one horn above the earth in order to mark the spot, and once

collect the skeletons or decaying bodies, in order that they might be

The people of Busiris patronised a savage type of religion. During the
festival of Isis they gave themselves up to fierce conflicts, their
fanatical fury even infecting strangers who chanced to be present. The
Carians also had hit upon a means of outdoing the extravagance of the
natives themselves: like the Shiite Mohammedans of the present day
at the festival of the Hassanên, they slashed their faces with knives
amidst shrieks and yells. At Paprêmis a pitched battle formed part of
the religious observances: it took place, however, under certain special
conditions. On the evening of the festival of Anhurît, as the sun went
down, a number of priests performed a hasty sacrifice in the temple,
while the remainder of the local priesthood stationed themselves at
the gate armed with heavy cudgels. When the ceremony was over, the
celebrants placed the statue of the god on a four-wheeled car as though
about to take it away to some other locality, but their colleagues
at the gate opposed its departure and barred the way. It was at this
juncture that the faithful intervened; they burst in the door and set
upon the priests with staves, the latter offering a stout resistance.
The cudgels were heavy, the arms that wielded them lusty, and the fight
lasted a long time, yet no one was ever killed in the fray&mdash;at least,
so the priests averred&mdash;and I am at a loss to understand why Herodotus,
who was not a native of Paprêmis, should have been so unkind as to doubt
their testimony.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The god whom the Greeks identified with their Ares was
     Anhurît, as is proved by one of the Leyden Papyri. So, too,
     in modern times at Cairo, it used to be affirmed that no
     Mohammedan who submitted to the dôseh was ever seriously
     injured by the hoofs of the horse which trampled over the
     bodies extended on the ground.

<p>
It is nearly always in connection with some temple or religious festival
that he refers to the towns of the Delta, and, indeed, in most of the
minor cities of Egypt, just as in those of modern Italy there is little
to interest visitors except the religious monuments or ceremonies.
Herodotus went to Tanis or Mendes as we go to Orvieto or Loretto, to
admire the buildings or pay our devotions at a famous shrine. More
often than not the place was nothing in itself, consisting merely of a
fortified enclosure, a few commonplace houses occupied by the wealthy
inhabitants or by government officials, and on mounds of ancient
<i>debris</i>, the accumulation of centuries, a number of ephemeral hovels
built of clay, or dried bricks, divided into irregular blocks by winding
alleys. The whole local interest was centred in the sanctuary and its
inmates, human and divine. The traveller made his way in as best he
could, went into ecstasies over the objects that were shown to him, and
as soon as he had duly gone the rounds, set out for the next place on
his list, deeming himself lucky if he happened to arrive during one
of the annual fairs, such as that of Bubastis, for instance. Bands
of pilgrims flocked in from all parts of Egypt; the river craft were
overflowing with men and women, who converted the journey into one long
carnival. Every time the vessel put in to land, the women rushed on
shore, amid the din of castanets and flutes, and ran hither and thither
challenging the women of the place with abuse to dance against them with
uplifted garments. To the foreigners there was little to distinguish the
festival of Bastît from many other Egyptian ceremonies of the kind; it
consisted of a solemn procession, accompanied by the singing of hymns
and playing of harps, dancing and sacrifices, but for weeks before and
after it the town was transformed into one vast pleasure-ground. The
people of Bubastis took a certain pride in declaring that more wine was
drunk in it during a single day than during the rest of the whole year.
Butô enjoyed exceptional popularity among the Greeks in Egypt. Its
patron goddess, the Isis who took refuge amid the pools in a moving
thicket of reeds and lotus, in order that she might protect her son
Horus from the jealousy of Typhon, reminded them of the story of Latona
and the cycle of the Delian legends; they, visited her in crowds,
and her oracle became to most of them what that of Delos was to their
brethren in Europe. At Butô they found a great temple, similar to all
Egyptian temples, a shrine in which the statues of the goddess continued
her mysterious existence, and, in the midst of the sacred lake, the
little island of Khemmis, which was said to float hither and thither
upon the waters. Herodotus did not venture to deny this absolutely,
but states that he had never seen it change its position or even stir:
perhaps his incredulity may have been quickened by the fact that this
miracle had already been inquired into by Hecatasus of Miletus, an
author who was his pet aversion. The priests of Butô declared that their
prophets had foretold everything that had happened for a long time past,
and for each event they had a version which redounded to the credit of
their goddess: she had shown Pheron how he might recover his sight,
had foretold how long the reign of Mykerinos would last, had informed
Psammetichus that he would be saved by men of brass rising out of the
sea, and had revealed to Cambyses that he should die in a town named
Ecbatana. Her priests had taken an active part in the revolt of
Khabbîsha against Darius, and had lost a goodly portion of their
treasure and endowments for their pains. They still retained their
prestige, however, in spite of the underhand rivalry of the oracle
of Zeus Ammon. The notaries of the Libyan deity could bring forward
miracles even more marvellous than those credited to the Egyptian
Latona, and in the case of many of the revolutions which had taken place
on the banks of the Nile, a version of the legend in his honour was
circulated side by side with the legends of Butô. The latter city lay
on the very outskirts of one of those regions which excited the greatest
curiosity among travellers, the almost inaccessible Bucolicum, where,
it was said, no rebel ever failed to find a safe refuge from his alien
pursuers. The Egyptians of the marshes were a very courageous race,
but savage, poor, and ill fed. They drank nothing but beer, and obtained
their oil not from the olive, but from the castor-oil plant,* and having
no corn, lived on the seeds or roots of the lotus, or even on the stalks
of the papyrus, which they roasted or boiled.
</p>
<pre>
     * It seems, moreover, that this custom was not confined to
     the Delta; Herodotus, in contrasting the custom of Bucolicum
     with that of the rest of Egypt, was evidently thinking of
     Sais, Memphis, and other great cities in which he had
     resided, where foreign olive oil obtained from Greece or
     Syria was generally used.
</pre>
<p>
Fish was their staple article of food, and this they obtained in
considerable quantity from Lake Menzaleh, the lagoons along the coast,
and the canals or pools left by the inundation. But little was known
of their villages or monuments, and probably they were not worth the
trouble of a visit after those of the cities of the plain: endless
stories were told of feats of brigandage and of the mysterious
hiding-places which these localities offered to every outlaw, one of the
most celebrated being the isle of Elbô, where the blind Anysis defied
the power of Ethiopia for thirty years, and in which the first Amyrtasus
found refuge. With the exception of a few merchants or adventurers
who visited them with an eye to gain, most travellers coming from or
returning to Asia avoided their territory, and followed the military
road along the Pelusiac arm of the Nile from Pehisium to Daphno or Zalu,
and from Daphnæ or Zalu to Bubastis. A little below Kerkasoron, near
the apex of the Delta, the pyramids stood out on the horizon, looking
insignificant at first, but afterwards so lofty that, during the period
of inundation, when the whole valley, from the mountains of Arabia to
those of Libya, was nothing but one vast river, a vessel seemed to
sail in their shadow for a long time before it reached their base. The
traveller passed Heliopolis on his left with its temple of the Sun,
next the supposed sources of the Northern Nile, the quarries of the Red
Mountain, and then entering at length the Nile itself, after a journey
of some hours, came to anchor by the quays of Memphis.
</p>
<p>
To the Greeks of that time, Memphis was very much what Cairo is to
us, viz. the typical Oriental city, the quintessence and chief
representative of ancient Egypt. In spite of the disasters which had
overwhelmed it during the last few centuries, it was still a very
beautiful city, ranking with Babylon as one of the largest in the world.
Its religious festivals, especially those in honour of Apis, attracted
numberless pilgrims to it at certain seasons of the year, and hosts of
foreigners, recruited from every imaginable race of the old continent,
resorted to it for purposes of trade. Most of the nationalities who
frequented it had a special quarter, which was named after them; the
Phoenicians occupied the <i>Tyrian Camp</i>, the Greeks and Carians the
<i>Hellenic Wall and Carian Wall</i>, and there were Oaromemphites or
Hellenomemphites side by side with the native inhabitants. A Persian
garrison was stationed within the White Wall, ready to execute the
satrap's orders in the event of rebellion, and could have held out for
a long time even after the rest of the country had fallen into the hands
of the insurgents. Animals which one would scarcely have expected
to find in the streets of a capital, such as cows, sheep, and goats,
wandered about unheeded in the most crowded thoroughfares; for the
common people, instead of living apart from their beasts, as the Greeks
did, stabled them in their own houses. Nor was this the only custom
which must have seemed strange in the eyes of a newly arrived visitor,
for the Egyptians might almost have been said to make a point of doing
everything differently from other nation's. The baker, seen at the
kneading-trough inside his shop, worked the dough with his foot; on the
other hand, the mason used no trowel in applying his mortar, and the
poorer classes scraped up handfuls of mud mixed with dung when they had
occasion to repair the walls of their hovels. In Greece, even the very
poorest retired to their houses and ate with closed doors; the Egyptians
felt no repugnance at eating and drinking in the open air, declaring
that unbecoming and improper acts should be performed in secret, but
seemly acts in public. The first blind alley they came to, a recess
between two hovels, the doorstep of a house or temple, any of these
seemed to them a perfectly natural place to dine in. Their bill of
fare was not a sumptuous one. A sort of flat pancake somewhat bitter in
taste, and made&mdash;not of corn or barley&mdash;but of spelt, a little oil, an
onion or a leek, with an occasional scrap of meat or poultry, washed
down by a jug of beer or wine; there was nothing here to tempt the
foreigner, and, besides, it would not have been thought right for him
to invite himself. A Greek who lived on the flesh of the cow was looked
upon as unclean in the highest degree; no Egyptian would have thought of
using the same pot or knife with him, or of kissing him on the mouth by
way of greeting. Moreover, Egyptian etiquette did not tolerate the same
familiarities as the Greek: two friends on catching sight of one another
paused before they met, bowed, then clasped one another round the knees
or pretended to do so. Young people gave way to an old man, or, if
seated, rose to let him pass. The traveller recalled the fact that the
Spartans behaved in the same way, and approved this mark of deference;
but nothing in his home-life had prepared him for the sight of
respectable women coming and going as they pleased, without escort and
unveiled, carrying burdens on their shoulders (whereas the men carried
them on their heads), going to market, keeping stalls or shops, while
their husbands or fathers stayed comfortably at home, wove cloth,
kneaded the potter's clay or turned the wheel, and worked at their
trades; no wonder that they were ready to believe that the man was the
slave, and the wife the mistress of the family. Some historians traced
the origin of these customs back to Osiris, others only as far as
Sesostris: Sesostris was the last resource of Greek historians when they
got into difficulties. The city was crowded with monuments; there was
the temple of the Phoenician Astarte, in which priests of Syrian descent
had celebrated the mysteries of the great goddess ever since the days
of the XVIIIth dynasty; then there was the temple of Râ, the temple of
Amon, the temple of Tamu, the temple of Bastît, and the temple of Isis.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This list is taken mainly from one of the mutilated
     letters found on the back of the <i>Sallier Papyrus</i>. The
     Phoenician Astarte, called a foreign Aphrodite by Herodotus,
     was regarded by the Egyptians as a counterpart of Bastît,
     lady of Onkhtoui.
</pre>
<p>
The temple of Phtah, as yet intact, provided the visitor with a
spectacle scarcely less admirable than that offered by the temple of the
Theban Amon at Karnak. The kings had modified the original plan as each
thought best, one adding obelisks or colossal statues, another a pylon,
a third a pillared hall. Completed in this way by the labours of a score
of dynasties, it formed, as it were, a microcosm of Egyptian history, in
which each image, inscription and statue, aroused the attention of the
curious. They naturally desired to learn who were the strangely dressed
races shown struggling in a battle scene, the name of the king who had
conquered them, and the reasons which had led him to construct this or
that part of a monument, and there were plenty of busybodies ready to
satisfy, as far as they could, the curiosity of visitors. Interpreters
were at hand who bartered such information as they possessed, and
the modern traveller who has had occasion to employ the services of a
dragoman will have no difficulty in estimating the value of intelligence
thus hawked about in ancient times. Priests of the lower class,
doorkeepers and sacristans were trained to act as <i>ciceroni</i>, and knew
the main outlines of the history of the temple in which they lived.
Menés planned it, Moeris added the northern propylæ, Ehampsinitus those
on the west, Psammetichus the south, Asychis those on the east, the most
noteworthy of them all. A native of Memphis, born at the foot of the
pyramids, had been familiar with the names of Menés and Cheops from
childhood; he was consequently apt to attribute to them everything of
importance achieved by the Pharaohs of the old days. Menés had built the
temple, Menés had founded the city, Menés had created the soil on
which the city stood, and preserved it from floods by his dykes. The
thoughtful traveller would assent, for had he not himself observed the
action of the mud; a day's journey from the coast one could not let down
a plummet without drawing it up covered with a blackish slime, a clear
proof that the Nile continued to gain upon the sea. Menés, at all
events, had really existed; but as to Asychis, Moris, Proteus, Pheron,
and most of the characters glibly enumerated by Herodotus, it would be
labour lost to search for their names among the inscriptions; they are
mere puppets of popular romance, some of their names, such as Pirâui or
Pruti, being nothing more than epithets employed by the story-tellers to
indicate in general terms the heroes of their tales. We can understand
how strangers, placed at the mercy of their dragoman, were misled by
this, and tempted to transform each title into a man, taking Pruti and
Pirâui to be Pharaoh Proteus and Pharaoh Pheron, each of them celebrated
for his fabulous exploits. The guides told Herodotus, and Herodotus
retails to us, as sober historical facts, the remedy employed by this
unhistorical Pheron in order to recover his sight; the adventures of
Paris and Helen at the court of Proteus,* and the droll tricks played by
a thief at the expense of the simple Ehampsinitus.

     with the "foreign Aphrodite" who had a temple in the Tyrian
     quarter at Memphis, and who was really a Semitic divinity.

The excursions made by the Greek traveller in the environs of Memphis
were very similar to those taken by modern visitors to Cairo: on the
opposite bank of the Nile there was Heliopolis with its temple of Râ,
then there were the quarries of Turah, which had been worked from time
immemorial, yet never exhausted, and from which the monuments he had
been admiring, and the very Pyramids themselves had been taken stone by
stone.*

ancient of all, having been erected by Uenephes, one of the kings of the
first dynasty, and they asked no further questions.

Their whole curiosity was reserved for the three giants at Gizeh and
their inmates, Cheops, Chephren, Mykerinos, and the fair Nitokris with
the rosy cheeks. Through all the country round, at Heliopolis, and even
in the Fayum itself, they heard the same names that had been dinned into
their ears at Memphis; the whole of the monuments were made to fit into
a single cycle of popular history, and what they learned at one place
completed, or seemed to complete, what they had learned at another.
</p>
<p>
I cannot tell whether many of them cared to stray much beyond Lake
Moris: the repressive measures of Ochus had, as it would appear,
interrupted for a time the regular trade which, ever since the Saite
kings of the XXVIth dynasty, had been carried on by the Greeks with the
Oases, by way of Abydos. A stranger who ventured as far as the Thebaid
would have found himself in the same plight as a European of the last
century who undertook to reach the first cataract. Their point
of departure&mdash;Memphis or Cairo&mdash;was very much the same; their
destinations&mdash;Elephantine and Assuan&mdash;differed but little. They employed
the same means of transport, for, excepting the cut of the sails, the
modern dahabeah is an exact counterpart of the pleasure and passenger
boats shown on the monuments. Lastly, they set out at the same time of
year, in November or December, after the floods had subsided. The same
length of time was required for the trip; it took a month to reach
Assuan from Cairo if the wind-were favourable, and if only such
stoppages were made as were strictly necessary for taking in fresh
provisions. Pococke, having left Cairo on the 6th of December, 1737,
about midday, was at Akhmîm by the 17th. He set sail again on the 18th,
stayed at Thebes from the 13th of January, 1738, till the 17th, and
finally moored at Assuan on the evening of January 20th, making in
all forty-five days, fourteen of which were spent at various
stopping-places. If the diary of a Greek excursionist or tourist had
come down to us, we should probably find in it entries of a very similar
kind.* The departure from Memphis would take place in November or
December; ten or twelve days later the traveller would find himself
at Panopolis;** from Panopolis to Elephantine, stopping at Coptos and
Thebes, would take about a month, allowing time for a stay at Thebes,
and returning to Memphis in February or March.
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus fixes twenty days for the voyage from Sais to
     Elephantine. This period of time must be probably correct,
     since at the present day dahabeahs constantly run from Cairo
     to the second cataract and back in two months, including
     stoppages of ten days to a fortnight for seeing the
     monuments. The twenty days of Herodotus represent the
     minimum duration of the voyage, without taking into account
     the stoppages and accidents which often delay sailing
     vessels on the Nile. Nine days, which Herodotus gives as the
     time for reaching Thebes, is not sufficient, if the voyage
     is undertaken in the usual way, stopping every evening for
     the night; but it would be possible if the navigation were
     uninterrupted day and night. This is now rarely done, but it
     might have been frequent in ancient times, especially in the
     service of the State.

     ** It would seem clear that Herodotus stopped at Panopolis
     and had communications with the people of the town.

The greater part of the time was employed in getting from one point to
another, and the necessity of taking advantage of a favourable wind in
going up the river, often obliged the travellers to neglect more than
one interesting locality.

The Greek was not so keenly alive to the picturesqueness of the scenes
through which he passed as the modern visitor, and in the account of
his travels he took no note of the long lines of laden boats going up or
down stream, nor of the vast sheet of water glowing in the midday sun,
nor of the mountains honeycombed with tombs and quarries, at the foot of
which he would be sailing day after day. What interested him above all
things was information with regard to the sources of the immense river
itself, and the reasons for its periodic inundation, and, according to
the mental attitude impressed on him by his education, he accepted the
mythological solution offered by the natives, or he sought for a more
natural one in the physical lore of his own <i>savants</i>: thus he was told
that the Nile took its rise at Elephantine, between the two rocks called
Krôphi and Môphi, and in showing them to him his informant would add
that Psammetichus I. had attempted to sound the depth of the river at
this point, but had failed to fathom it. At the few places where the
pilot of the barque put in to port, the population showed themselves
unfriendly, and refused to hold any communication with the Greeks.

The interpreters, who were almost all natives of the Delta, were not
always familiar with the people and customs of the Said, and felt almost
as completely foreign at Thebes as did their employers. Their office
was confined to translating the information furnished by the inhabitants
when the latter were sufficiently civilised to hold communication with
the travellers. What most astonished Herodotus at Panopolis was the
temple and the games held in honour, so he believed, of Perseus, the son
of Danaë. These exercises terminated in an attempt to climb a regular
"greasy pole" fixed in the ground, and strengthened right and left by
three rows of stays attached to the mast at different heights; as for
Perseus, he was the ithyphallic god of the locality, Mînu himself, one
of whose epithets&mdash;Pehresu, the runner&mdash;was confounded by the Greek ear
with the name of the hero. The dragomans, enlarging on this mistaken
identity, imagined that the town was the birthplace of Danaos and
Lyncseus; that Perseus, returning from Libya with the head of Medusa,
had gone out of his way to visit the cradle of his family, and that he
had instituted the games in remembrance of his stay there. Thebes had
become the ghost of its former self; the Persian governors had neglected
the city, and its princesses and their ministers were so impoverished
that they were unable to keep up its temples and palaces. Herodotus
scarcely mentions it, and we can hardly wonder at it: he had visited
the still flourishing Memphis, where the temples were cared for and
were filled with worshippers. What had Thebes to show him in the way of
marvels which he had not already seen, and that, too, in a better state
of preservation? His Theban ciceroni also told him the same stories that
he had heard in Lower Egypt, and he states that their information agreed
in the main with that which he had received at Memphis and Heliopolis,
which made it unnecessary to repeat it at length. Two or three things
only appeared to him worthy of mention. His admiration was first roused
by the 360 statues of the high priests of Amon which had already excited
the wonder of his rival Hecataeus; he noted that all these personages
were, without exception, represented as mere men, each the son of
another man, and he took the opportunity of ridiculing the vanity of his
compatriots, who did not hesitate to inscribe the name of a god at the
head of their genealogies, removed by some score of generations only
from their own. On the other hand, the temple servitors related to him
how two Theban priestesses, carried off by the Phoenicians and sold, one
in Libya and the other in Greece, had set up the first oracles known
in those two countries: Herodotus thereupon remembered the story he had
heard in Epirus of two black doves which had flown away from Thebes, one
towards the Oasis of Ammon, the other in the direction of Dodona; the
latter had alighted on an old beech tree, and in a human voice had
requested that a temple consecrated to Zeus should be founded on the
spot.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This indicates a confusion in the minds of the Egyptian
     dragomans with the two brooding birds of Osiris, Isis and
     Nephthys, considered as <i>Zarait</i>, that is to say, as two
     birds of a different species, according to the different
     traditions either vultures, rooks, or doves.
</pre>
<p>
Herodotus is quite overcome with joy at the thought that Greek
divination could thus be directly traced to that of Egypt, for like most
of his contemporaries, he felt that the Hellenic cult was ennobled by
the fact of its being derived from the Egyptian. The traveller on the
Nile had to turn homewards on reaching Elephantine, as that was the
station of the last Persian garrison. Nubia lay immediately beyond the
cataract, and the Ethiopians at times crossed the frontier and carried
their raids as far as Thebes. Elephantine, like Assuan at the present
day, was the centre of a flourishing trade. Here might be seen
Kushites from Napata or Meroë, negroes from the Upper Nile and the Bahr
el-Ghazal, and Ammonians, from all of whom the curious visitor might
glean information while frequenting the bazaars. The cataract was
navigable all the year round, and the natives in its vicinity enjoyed
the privilege of piloting freight boats through its difficult channel.
It took four days to pass through it, instead of the three, or even
two, which suffice at the present day. Above it, the Nile spread out
and resembled a lake dotted over with islands, several of which, such
as Phike and Biggeh, contained celebrated temples, which were as much
frequented by the Ethiopians as by the Egyptians.

Correctly speaking, it was not Egypt herself that the Greeks saw,
but her external artistic aspect and the outward setting of Egyptian
civilisation. The vastness of her monuments, the splendour of her tombs,
the pomp of her ceremonies, the dignity and variety of her religious
formulas, attracted their curiosity and commanded their respect: the
wisdom of the Egyptians had passed into a proverb with them, as it had
with the Hebrews. But if they had penetrated behind the scenes, they
would have been obliged to acknowledge that beneath this attractive
exterior there was hopeless decay. As with all creatures when they have
passed their prime, Egypt had begun to grow old, and was daily losing
her elasticity and energy. Her spirit had sunk into a torpor, she
had become unresponsive to her environment, and could no longer adapt
herself to the form she had so easily acquired in her youth: it was as
much as she could do to occupy fully the narrower limits to which she
had been reduced, and to maintain those limits unbroken. The instinct
which made her shrink from the intrusion of foreign customs and ideas,
or even mere contact with nations of recent growth, was not the mere
outcome of vanity. She realised that she maintained her integrity only
by relying on the residue of her former solidarity and on the force of
custom. The slightest disturbance of the equilibrium established among
her members, instead of strengthening her, would have robbed her of the
vigour she still possessed, and brought about her dissolution.
</p>


<p>
She owed whatever activity she possessed to impulses imparted to her by
the play of her ancient mechanism&mdash;a mechanism so stable in its action,
and so ingeniously constructed, that it had still a reserve of power
within it sufficient to keep the whole in motion for centuries, provided
there was no attempt to introduce new wheels among the old. She had
never been singularly distinguished for her military qualities; not that
she was cowardly, and shrank from facing death, but because she lacked
energy and enthusiasm for warlike enterprise. The tactics and armaments
by which she had won her victories up to her prime, had at length become
fetters which she was no longer inclined to shake off, and even if she
was still able to breed a military caste, she was no longer able to
produce armies fit to win battles without the aid of mercenaries. In
order to be successful in the field, she had to associate with her own
troops recruits from other countries&mdash;Libyans, Asiatics, and Greeks, who
served to turn the scale. The Egyptians themselves formed a compact body
in this case, and bearing down upon the enemy already engaged by the
mercenaries, broke through his ranks by their sheer weight, or, if they
could not accomplish this, they stood their ground bravely, taking to
flight only when the vacancies in their ranks showed them that further
resistance was impossible. The machinery of government, like the
organisation of their armies, had become antiquated and degenerate.

<p>
The nobility were as turbulent as in former times, and the royal
authority was as powerless now as of old to assert itself in the absence
of external help, or when treason was afoot among the troops. Religion
alone maintained its ascendency, and began to assume to itself
the loyalty once given to the Pharaoh, and the devotion previously
consecrated to the fatherland. The fellahîn had never fully realised the
degradation involved in serving a stranger, and what they detested in
the Persian king was not exactly the fact that he was a Persian. Their
national pride, indeed, always prompted them to devise some means
of connecting the foreign monarch with their own solar line, and to
transform an Achæmenian king into a legitimate Pharaoh. That which was
especially odious to them in a Cambyses or an Ochus was the disdain
which such sovereigns displayed for their religion, and the persecution
to which they subjected the immortals. They accustomed themselves
without serious repining to have no longer one of their own race upon
the throne, and to behold their cities administered by Asiatics, but
they could not understand why the foreigner preferred his own gods,
and would not admit Amon, Phtah, Horus, and Râ to the rank of supreme
deities. Ochus had, by his treatment of the Apis and the other divine
animals, put it out of his power ever to win their good will. His
brutality had made an irreconcilable enemy of that state which alone
gave signs of vitality among the nations of the decaying East. This was
all the more to be regretted, since the Persian empire, in spite of the
accession of power which it had just manifested, was far from having
regained the energy which had animated it, not perhaps in the time
of Darius, but at all events under the first Xerxes. The army and the
wealth of the country were doubtless still intact&mdash;an army and a revenue
which, in spite of all losses, were still the largest in the world&mdash;but
the valour of the troops was not proportionate to their number. The
former prowess of the Persians, Medians, Bactrians, and other tribes of
Iran showed no degeneracy: these nations still produced the same race
of brave and hardy foot-soldiers, the same active and intrepid horsemen;
but for a century past there had not been the improvements either in
the armament of the troops or in the tactics of the generals which were
necessary to bring them up to the standard of excellence of the Greek
army. The Persian king placed great faith in extraordinary military
machines. He believed in the efficacy of chariots armed with scythes;
besides this, his relations with India had shown him what use his
Oriental neighbours made of elephants, and having determined to employ
these animals, he had collected a whole corps of them, from which he.
hoped great things. In spite of the addition of these novel recruits, it
was not on the Asiatic contingents that he chiefly relied in the event
of war, but on the mercenaries who' were hired at great expense, and who
formed the chief support of his power. From the time of Artaxerxes II.
onwards, it was the Greek hoplites and peltasts who had always decided
the issue of the Persian battles. The expeditions both by land and
sea had been under the conduct of Athenian or Spartan generals&mdash;Conon,
Chabrias, Iphi-crates, Agesilas, Timotheus, and their pupils; and again
also it was to the Greeks&mdash;to the Rhodian Mentor and to, Memnon&mdash;that
Ochus had owed his successes. The older nations&mdash;Egypt, Syria, Chaldæa,
and Elam&mdash;had all had their day of supremacy; they had declined in the
course of centuries, and Assyria had for a short time united them under
her rule. On the downfall of Assyria, the Iranians had succeeded to
her heritage, and they had built up a single empire comprising all the
states which had preceded them in Western Asia; but decadence had fallen
upon them also, and when they had been masters for scarcely two short
centuries, they were in their turn threatened with destruction. Their
rule continued to be universal, not by reason of its inherent vigour,
but on account of the weakness of their subjects and neighbours, and a
determined attack on any of the frontiers of the empire would doubtless
have resulted in its overthrow.
</p>
<p>
Greece herself was too demoralised to cause Darius any grave anxiety.
Not only had she renounced all intention of attacking the great king in
his own domain, as in the days of the Athenian hegemony, when she could
impose her own conditions of peace, but her perpetual discords had
yielded her an easy prey to Persia, and were likely to do so more and
more. The Greek cities chose the great king as the arbiter in their
quarrels; they vied with each other in obtaining his good will, his
subsidies in men and vessels, and his darics: they armed or disarmed at
his command, and the day seemed at hand when they would become a normal
dependency of Persia, little short of a regular satrapy like Asiatic
Hellas. One chance of escape from such a fate remained to them&mdash;if one
or other of them, or some neighbouring state, could acquire such an
ascendency as to make it possible to unite what forces remained to them
under one rule. Macedonia in particular, having hitherto kept aloof from
the general stream of politics, had at this juncture begun to shake
off its lethargy, and had entered with energy into the Hellenic concert
under the auspices of its king, Philip. Bagoas recognised the danger
which threatened his people in the person of this ambitious sovereign,
and did not hesitate to give substantial support to the adversaries of
the Macedonian prince; Chersobleptes of Thrace and the town of Perinthus
receiving from him such succour as enabled them to repulse Philip
successfully (340). Unfortunately, while Bagoas was endeavouring
to avert danger in this quarter, his rivals at court endeavoured to
prejudice the mind of the king against him, and their intrigues were so
successful that he found himself ere long condemned to the alternative
of murdering his sovereign or perishing himself. He therefore poisoned
Ochus, to avoid being assassinated or put to the torture, and placed on
the throne Arses, the youngest of the king's sons, while he caused the
remaining royal children to be put to death (336).* Egypt hailed
this tragic end as a mark of the vengeance of the gods whom Ochus had
outraged. A report was spread that the eunuch was an Egyptian, that he
had taken part in the murder of the Apis under fear of death, but that
when he was sure of his own safety he had avenged the sacrilege. As soon
as the poison had taken effect, it was said he ate a portion of the dead
body and threw the remainder to the cats: he then collected the bones
and made them into whistles and knife-handles.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Plutarch calls the successor of Ochus Oarses, which
     recalls the name which Dinon gives to Artaxerxes II.
     Diodorus says that Bagoas destroyed the whole family of
     Ochus, but he is mistaken. Arrian mentions a son of Ochus
     about 330, and several other members of the royal Achæmenian
     race are known to have been living in the time of Alexander.

     ** The body of the enemy thrown to the cats to be devoured
     is a detail added by the popular imagination, which crops up
     again in the Tale of Satni Khâmois.
</pre>
<p>
Ochus had astonished his contemporaries by the rapidity with which he
had re-established the integrity of the empire; they were pleased to
compare him with the heroes of his race, with Cyrus, Cambyses, and
Darius. But to exalt him to such a level said little for their moral or
intellectual perceptions, since in spite of his victories he was merely
a despot of the ordinary type; his tenacity degenerated into brutal
obstinacy, his severity into cruelty, and if he obtained successes,
they were due rather to his generals and his ministers than to his own
ability. His son Arses was at first content to be a docile instrument
in the hands of Bagoas; but when the desire for independence came to him
with the habitual exercise of power, and he began to chafe at his bonds,
the eunuch sacrificed him to his own personal safety, and took his life
as he had done that of his father in the preceding year (336). So
many murders following each other in rapid succession had considerably
reduced the Achsemenian family, and Bagoas for a moment was puzzled
where to find a king: he at length decided in favour of Codomannos, who
according to some was a great-grandson of Darius II., but according to
others was not of the royal line, but had in his youth been employed as
a courier. He had distinguished himself in the hostilities against the
Casduians, and had been nominated satrap of Armenia by Ochus as a reward
for his bravery. He assumed at his accession the name of Darius; brave,
generous, clement, and possessed with an ardent desire to do right,
he was in every way the superior of his immediate predecessors, and he
deserved to have reigned at a time when the empire was less threatened.
Bagoas soon perceived that his new protégé, whose conduct he had
reckoned on directing as he pleased, intended to govern for himself, and
he therefore attempted to get rid of him; Bagoas was, however, betrayed
by his accomplices, and compelled to drink the poison which he had
prepared for Darius. These revolutions had distracted the attention of
the court of Susa from the events which were taking place on the shores
of the Ægean, and Philip had taken advantage of them to carry into
effect the designs against Persia which he had been long meditating.
After having been victorious against the Greeks, he had despatched an
army of ten thousand men into Asia under the command of Parmenion and
Attains (336). We may ask if it were not he who formed the project of
universal conquest which was so soon to be associated with the name of
his son Alexander. He was for the moment content to excite revolt among
the cities of the Ægean littoral, and restore to them that liberty of
which they had been deprived for nearly a century. He himself followed
as soon as these lost children of Greece had established themselves
firmly in Asia. The story of his assassination on the eve of his
departure is well known (336), and of the difficulties which compelled
Alexander to suspend the execution of the plans which his father had
made. Darius attempted to make use of the respite thus afforded him by
fortune; he adopted the usual policy of liberally bribing one part of
Greece to take up arms against Macedonia&mdash;a method which was at first
successful. While Alexander was occupied in the destruction of Thebes,
the Rhodian general Memnon, to whom had been entrusted the defence of
Asia Minor, forced the invaders to entrench themselves in the Troad. If
the Persian fleet had made its appearance in good time, and had kept
an active watch over the straits, the advance-guard of the Macedonians
would have succumbed to the enemy before the main body of the troops
had succeeded in joining them in Asia, and it was easy to foretell
what would have been the fate of an enterprise inaugurated by such
a disaster. Persia, however, had not yet learnt to seize the crucial
moment for action: her vessels were still arming when the enemy made
their appearance on the European shore of Hellespont, and Alexander had
ample time to embark and disembark the whole of his army without having
to draw his sword from the scabbard. He was accompanied by about thirty
thousand foot soldiers and four thousand five hundred horse; the finest
troops commanded by the best generals of the time&mdash;Parmenion, his two
sons Nikanor and Philotas, Crater, Clitos, Antigonus, and others
whose names are familiar to us all; a larger force than Memnon and his
subordinates were able to bring up to oppose him, at all events at
the opening of the campaign, during the preliminary operations which
determined the success of the enterprise.
</p>
<p>
The first years of the campaign seem like a review of the countries
and nations which in bygone times had played the chief part in Oriental
history. An engagement at the fords of the Granicus, only a few days
after the crossing of the Hellespont, placed Asia Minor at the mercy
of the invader (334). Mysia, Lydia, Caria, and Lycia tendered their
submission, Miletus and Halicarnassus being the only towns to offer any
resistance. In the spring of 333, Phrygia followed the general movement,
in company with Cappadocia and Cilicia; these represented the Hittite
and Asianic world, the last representatives of which thus escaped from
the influences of the East and passed under the Hellenic supremacy.

At the foot of the Amanus, Alexander came into conflict not only with
the generals of Darius, but with the great king himself. The Amanus, and
the part of the Taurus which borders on the Euphrates valley, had always
constituted the line of demarcation between the domain of the races of
the Asianic peninsula and that of the Semitic peoples.

A second battle near the Issus, at the entrance to the Cilician gates,
cleared the ground, and gave the conqueror time to receive the homage of
the maritime provinces. Both Northern and Coele-Syria submitted to him
from Samosata to Damascus.

The less important towns of Phonicia, such as Arvad, Byblos, Sidon, and
those of Cyprus, followed their example; but Tyre closed its gates,
and trusted to its insular position for the preservation of its
independence, as it had done of old in the time of Sennacherib and of
Nebuchadrezzar. It was not so much a scrupulous feeling of loyalty which
emboldened her to take this step, as a keen realisation of what her
conquest by the Macedonian would entail. It was entirely-owing to Persia
that she had not succumbed in all parts of the Eastern Mediterranean in
that struggle with Greece which had now lasted for centuries: Persia had
not only arrested the progress of Hellenic colonisation in Cyprus, but
had given a fresh impulse to that of Tyre, and Phoenician influence
had regained its ascendency over a considerable part of the island. The
surrender of Tyre, therefore, would be equivalent to a Greek victory,
and would bring about the decay of the city; hence its inhabitants
preferred hostilities, and they were prolonged in desperation over a
period of seven months. At the end of that time Alexander succeeded in
reducing the place by constructing a dyke or causeway, by means of
which he brought his machines of war up to the foot of the ramparts, and
filled in the channel which separated the town from the mainland; the
island thus became a peninsula, and Tyre henceforth was reduced to
the rank of an ordinary town, still able to maintain her commercial
activity, but having lost her power as an independent state (332).
Phoenicia being thus brought into subjection, Judæa and Samaria yielded
to the conqueror without striking a blow, though the fortress of Gaza
followed the example set by Tyre, and for the space of two months
blocked the way to the Delta. Egypt revolted at the approach of her
liberator, and the rising was so unanimous as to dismay the satrap
Mazakes, who capitulated at the first summons. Alexander passed the
winter on the banks of the Nile. Finding that the ancient capitals of
the country&mdash;Thebes, Sais, and even Memphis itself&mdash;occupied positions
which were no longer suited to the exigencies of the times, he founded
opposite to the island of Pharos, in the township of Eakotis, a city
to which he gave his own name. The rapid growth of the prosperity of
Alexandria showed how happy the founder had been in the choice of its
site: in less than half a century from the date of its foundation, it
had eclipsed all the other capitals of the Eastern Mediterranean, and
had become the centre of African Hellenism. While its construction
was in progress, Alexander, having had opportunities of studying the
peculiarities and characteristics of the Egyptians, had decided to
perform the one act which would conciliate the good feeling of the
natives, and secure for him their fidelity during his wars in the East:
he selected from among their gods the one who was also revered by the
Greeks, Zeus-Amnion, and repaired to the Oasis that he might be adopted
by the deity. As a son of the god, he became a legitimate Pharaoh,
an Egyptian like themselves, and on returning to Memphis he no longer
hesitated to adopt the <i>pschent</i> crown with the accompanying ancient
rites. He returned to Asia early in the year 331, and crossed the
Euphrates. Darius had attempted to wrest Asia Minor from his grasp, but
Antigonus, the governor of Phrygia, had dispersed the troops despatched
for this purpose in 332, and Alexander was able to push forward
fearlessly into those regions beyond the Euphrates, where the Ten
Thousand had pursued their victorious march before him. He crossed the
Tigris about the 20th of September, and a week later fell in with
his rival in the very heart of Assyria, not far from, the village
of Gaugamela, where he took up a position which had been previously
studied, and was particularly suited for the evolutions of cavalry.

At the Granicus and near Issus, the Greek element had played an
important part among the forces which contested the field; on this
occasion, however, the great king was accompanied by merely two or three
thousand mercenaries, while, on the other hand, the whole of Asia seemed
to have roused herself for a last effort, and brought forward her most
valiant troops to oppose the disciplined ranks of the Macedonians.
Persians, Susians, Medes, Armenians, Iranians from Bactriana, Sakae, and
Indians were all in readiness to do their best, and were accompanied
by every instrument of military warfare employed in Oriental tactics;
chariots armed with scythes, the last descendants of the chariotry which
had dominated all the battle-fields from the time of the XVIIIth Theban
dynasty down to the latest Sargonids, and, employed side by side with
these relics of a bygone day, were Indian elephants, now for the first
time brought into use against European battalions. These picked troops
sold their lives dearly, but the perfection of the Macedonian arms, and,
above all, the superiority of the tactics employed by their generals,
carried the day; the evening of the 30th of September found Darius in
flight, and the Achæmenian empire crushed by the furious charges of
Alexander's squadrons. Babylon fell into their hands a few days later,
followed by Susa, and in the spring of 330, Ecbatana; and shortly after
Darius met his end on the way to Media, assassinated by the last of his
generals.

With his death, Persia sank back into the obscurity from which Cyrus had
raised her rather more than two centuries previously. With the exception
of the Medes, none of the nations which had exercised the hegemony of
the East before her time, not even Assyria, had had at their disposal
such a wealth of resources and had left behind them so few traces of
their power. A dozen or so of palaces, as many tombs, a few scattered
altars and stelæ, remains of epics preserved by the Greeks, fragments of
religious books, often remodelled, and issuing in the Avesta&mdash;when
we have reckoned up all that remains to us of her, what do we find
to compare in interest and in extent with the monuments and wealth of
writings bequeathed to us by Egypt and Chaldæa? The Iranians received
Oriental civilisation at a time when the latter was in its decline, and
caught the spirit of decadence in their contact with it. In succeeding
to the patrimony of the nations they conquered, they also inherited
their weakness; in a few years they had lost all the vigour of their
youth, and were barely able to maintain the integrity of the empire
they had founded. Moreover, the great peoples to whom they succeeded,
although lacking the vigour necessary for the continuance of their
independent existence, had not yet sunk so low as to acquiesce in their
own decay, and resign themselves to allowing their national life to be
absorbed is that of another power: they believed that they would emerge
from the crisis, as they had done from so many others, with fresh
strength, and, as soon as an occasion presented itself, they renewed the
war against their Iranian suzerain. Prom, the first to the latest of the
sovereigns bearing the name of Darius, the history of the Achæmenids in
an almost uninterrupted series of internal wars and provincial revolts.
The Greeks of Ionia, the Egyptians, Chaldæans, Syrians, and the tribes
of Asia Minor, all rose one after another, sometimes alone, sometimes
in concert; some carrying on hostilities for not more than two or
three years; others, like Egypt, maintaining them for more than half a
century. They were not discouraged by the reprisals which followed each
of these rebellions; they again had recourse to arms as soon as there
seemed the least chance of success, and they renewed the struggle till
from sheer exhaustion the sword fell from their hand. Persia was worn
out by this perpetual warfare, in which at the same time each of her
rivals expended the last relics of their vitality, and when Macedonia
entered on the scene, both lords and vassals were reduced to such a
state of prostration, that it was easy to foretell their approaching
end. The old Oriental world was in its death-throes; but before it
passed away, the successful audacity of Alexander had summoned Greece to
succeed to its inheritance.
