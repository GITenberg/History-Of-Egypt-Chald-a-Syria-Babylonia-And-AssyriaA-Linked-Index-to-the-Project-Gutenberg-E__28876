<h2>
    CHAPTER I&mdash;THE IRANIAN CONQUEST
</h2>

<p>
<i>The Iranian religions&mdash;Cyrus in Lydia and at Babylon: Cambyses in Egypt
&mdash;Darius and the organisation of the empire.</i>
</p>
<p>
The Median empire is the least known of all those which held sway for a
time over the destinies of a portion of Western Asia. The reason of this
is not to be ascribed to the shortness of its duration: the Chaldæan
empire of Nebuchadrezzar lasted for a period quite as brief, and yet the
main outlines of its history can be established with some certainty in
spite of large blanks and much obscurity. Whereas at Babylon, moreover,
original documents abound, enabling us to put together, feature by
feature, the picture of its ancient civilisation and of the chronology
of its kings, we possess no contemporary monuments of Ecbatana to
furnish direct information as to its history. To form any idea of
the Median kings or their people, we are reduced to haphazard notices
gleaned from the chroniclers of other lands, retailing a few isolated
facts, anecdotes, legends, and conjectures, and, as these materials
reach us through the medium of the Babylonians or the Greeks of the
fifth or sixth century B.C., the picture which we endeavour to compose
from them is always imperfect or out of perspective. We seemingly
catch glimpses of ostentatious luxury, of a political and military
organisation, and a method of government analogous to that which
prevailed at later periods among the Persians, but more imperfect,
ruder, and nearer to barbarism&mdash;a Persia, in fact, in the rudimentary
stage, with its ruling spirit and essential characteristics as yet
undeveloped. The machinery of state had doubtless been adopted almost
in its entirety from the political organisations which obtained in the
kingdoms of Assyria, Elam, and Chaldæa, with which sovereignties the
founders of the Median empire had held in turns relations as vassals,
enemies, and allies; but once we penetrate this veneer of Mesopotamian
civilisation and reach the inner life of the people, we find in the
religion they profess&mdash;mingled with some borrowed traits&mdash;a world of
unfamiliar myths and dogmas of native origin.
</p>
<p>
The main outlines of this religion were already fixed when the
Medes rose in rebellion against Assur-bani-pal; and the very name of
<i>Confessor</i>&mdash;Fravartîsh&mdash;applied to the chief of that day, proves that
it was the faith of the royal family. It was a religion common to all
the Iranians, the Persians as well as the Medes, and legend honoured as
its first lawgiver and expounder an ancient prophet named Zarathustra,
known to us as Zoroaster.* Most classical writers relegated Zoroaster
to some remote age of antiquity&mdash;thus he is variously said to have lived
six thousand years before the death of Plato,** five thousand before the
Trojan war,*** one thousand before Moses, and six hundred before Xerxes'
campaign against Athens; while some few only affirmed that he had lived
at a comparatively recent period, and made him out a disciple of the
philosopher Pythagoras, who flourished about the middle of the fifth
century B.C.
</p>
<pre>
     * The name Zarathustra has been interpreted in a score of
     different ways. The Greeks sometimes attributed to it the
     meaning "worshipper of the stars," probably by reason of the
     similarity in sound of the termination "-astres" of
     Zoroaster with the word "astron." Among modern writers, H.
     Rawlinson derived it from the Assyrian Zîru-Ishtar, "the
     seed of Ishtar," but the etymology now most generally
     accepted is that of Burnouf, according to which it would
     signify "the man with gold-coloured camels," the "possessor
     of tawny camels." The ordinary Greek form Zoroaster seems to
     be derived from some name quite distinct from Zarathustra.

     ** This was, as Pliny records, the opinion of Eudoxus; not
     Eudoxus of Cnidus, pupil of Plato, as is usually stated, but
     a more obscure personage, Eudoxus of Rhodes.

     *** This was the statement of Hermodorus.
</pre>
<p>
According to the most ancient national traditions, he was born in the
Aryanem-vaêjô, or, in other words, in the region between the Araxes and
the Kur, to the west of the Caspian Sea. Later tradition asserted
that his conception was attended by supernatural circumstances, and
the miracles which accompanied his birth announced the advent of a saint
destined to regenerate the world by the revelation of the True Law. In
the belief of an Iranian, every man, every living creature now existing
or henceforth to exist, not excluding the gods themselves, possesses a
Frôhar, or guardian spirit, who is assigned to him at his entrance into
the world, and who is thenceforth devoted entirely to watching over
his material and moral well-being,* About the time appointed for the
appearance of the prophet, his Frôhar was, by divine grace, imprisoned
in the heart of a Haoma,** and was absorbed, along with the juice of
the plant, by the priest Purushâspa,*** during a sacrifice, a ray of
heavenly glory descending at the same time into the bosom of a maiden of
noble race, named Dughdôva, whom Purushâspa shortly afterwards espoused.
</p>
<pre>
     * The Fravashi (for <i>fravarti</i>, from <i>fra-var</i>, "to support,
     nourish"), or the <i>frôhar (feruer)</i>, is, properly speaking,
     the nurse, the genius who nurtures. Many of the practices
     relating to the conception and cult of the Fravashis seem to
     me to go back to the primitive period of the Iranian
     religions.

     ** The haoma is an <i>Asclepias Sarcostema Viminalis</i>.

     *** The name signifies "He who has many horses."
</pre>
<p>
Zoroaster was engendered from the mingling of the Frôhar with the
celestial ray. The evil spirit, whose supremacy he threatened,
endeavoured to destroy him as soon as he saw the light, and despatched
one of his agents, named Bôuiti, from the country of the far north to
oppose him; but the infant prophet immediately pronounced the formula
with which the psalm for the offering of the waters opens: "The will of
the Lord is the rule of good!" and proceeded to pour libations in honour
of the river Darêja, on the banks of which he had been born a moment
before, reciting at the same time the "profession of faith which puts
evil spirits to flight." Bôuiti fled aghast, but his master set to work
upon some fresh device. Zoroaster allowed him, however, no time to
complete his plans: he rose up, and undismayed by the malicious riddles
propounded to him by his adversary, advanced against him with his hands
full of stones&mdash;stones as large as a house&mdash;with which the good deity
supplied him. The mere sight of him dispersed the demons, and they
regained the gates of their hell in headlong flight, shrieking out, "How
shall we succeed in destroying him? For he is the weapon which strikes
down evil beings; he is the scourge of evil beings." His infancy
and youth were spent in constant disputation with evil spirits: ever
assailed, he ever came out victorious, and issued more perfect from each
attack. When he was thirty years old, one of the good spirits, Vôhumanô,
appeared to him, and conducted him into the presence of Ahura-mazdâ,
the Supreme Being. When invited to question the deity, Zoroaster asked,
"Which is the best of the creatures which are upon the earth?" The
answer was, that the man whose heart is pure, he excels among his
fellows. He next desired to know the names and functions of the angels,
and the nature and attributes of evil. His instruction ended, he crossed
a mountain of flames, and underwent a terrible ordeal of purification,
during which his breast was pierced with a sword, and melted lead poured
into his entrails without his suffering any pain: only after this ordeal
did he receive from the hands of Ahura-mazdâ the Book of the Law, the
Avesta, was then sent back to his native land bearing his precious
burden. At that time, Vîshtâspa, son of Aurvatâspa, was reigning over
Bactria. For ten years Zoroaster had only one disciple, his cousin
Maidhyoi-Mâonha, but after that he succeeded in converting, one
after the other, the two sons of Hvôgva, the grand vizir Jâmâspa, who
afterwards married the prophet's daughter, and Frashaoshtra, whose
daughter Hvôgvi he himself espoused; the queen, Hutaosa, was the next
convert, and afterwards, through her persuasions, the king Vîshtâspa
himself became a disciple. The triumph of the good cause was hastened by
the result of a formal disputation between the prophet and the wise men
of the court: for three days they essayed to bewilder him with their
captious objections and their magic arts, thirty standing on his right
hand and thirty on his left, but he baffled their wiles, aided by grace
from above, and having forced them to avow themselves at the end of
their resources, he completed his victory by reciting the Avesta before
them. The legend adds, that after rallying the majority of the people
round him, he lived to a good old age, honoured of all men for his
saintly life. According to some accounts, he was stricken dead by
lightning,* while others say he was killed by a Turanian soldier,
Brâtrôk-rêsh, in a war against the Hyaonas.
</p>
<pre>
     * This is, under very diverse forms, the version preferred
     by Western historians of the post-classical period.
</pre>
<p>
The question has often been asked whether Zoroaster belongs to
the domain of legend or of history. The only certain thing we know
concerning him is his name; all the rest is mythical, poetic, or
religious fiction. Classical writers attributed to him the composition
or editing of all the writings comprised in Persian literature: the
whole consisted, they said, of two hundred thousand verses which had
been expounded and analysed by Hermippus in his commentaries on the
secret doctrines of the Magi. The Iranians themselves averred that he
had given the world twenty-one volumes&mdash;the twenty-one <i>Nasks</i> of the
Avesta,* which the Supreme Deity had created from the twenty-one words
of the Magian profession of faith, the <i>Ahuna Vairya</i>. King Vîshtâspa is
said to have caused two authentic copies of the Avesta&mdash;which contained
in all ten or twelve hundred chapters**&mdash;to be made, one of which
was consigned to the archives of the empire, the other laid up in
the treasury of a fortress, either Shapîgân, Shîzîgân, Samarcand, or
Persepolis.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The word <i>Avesta</i>, in Pehlevi <i>Apastâk</i>, whence come the
     Persian forms <i>âvasta, ôstâ</i>, is derived from the
     Achæmenian word <i>Abasta</i>, which signifies <i>law</i> in the
     inscriptions of Darius. The term Zend-Avesta, commonly used
     to designate the sacred book of the Persians, is incorrectly
     derived from the expression <i>Apastâc u Zend</i>, which in
     Pehlevi designates first the law itself, and then the
     translation and commentary in more modern language which
     conduces to a <i>knowledge (Zend)</i> of the law. The customary
     application, therefore, of the name Zend to the language of
     the Avesta is incorrect.

     ** The Dinkart fixes the number of chapters at 1000, and the
     Shâh-Nâmak at 1200, written on plates of gold. According to
     Masudi, the book itself and the two commentaries formed
     12,000 volumes, written in letters of gold, the twenty-one
     Nasks each contained 200 pages, and the whole of these
     writings had been inscribed on 12,000 cow-hides.

     *** The site of Shapîgân or Shaspîgân is unknown. J.
     Darmesteter suggests that it ought to be read as <i>Shizîgân</i>,
     which would permit of the identification of the place with
     Shîz, one of the ancient religious centres of Iran, whose
     temple was visited by the Sassanids on their accession to
     the throne. According to the Ardâ-Vîrâf the law was
     preserved at Istakhr, or Persepolis, according to the Shâh-
     Nâmak at Samarcand in the temple of the Fire-god.

Alexander is said to have burnt the former copy: the latter, stolen by
the Greeks, is reported to have been translated into their language and
to have furnished them with all their scientific knowledge. One of the
Arsacids, Vologesus I., caused a search to be made for all the fragments
which existed either in writing or in the memory of the faithful,* and
this collection, added to in the reign of the Sassanid king, Ardashîr
Bâbagan, by the high priest Tansar, and fixed in its present form under
Sapor I., was recognised as the religious code of the empire in the time
of Sapor II., about the fourth century of the Christian era.*** The text
is composed, as may be seen, of three distinct strata, which are by no
means equally ancient;*** one can, nevertheless, make out from it with
sufficient certainty the principal features of the religion and cult of
Iran, such as they were under the Achæmenids, and perhaps even under the
hegemony of the Medes.

     the contemporary of Nero.

     *** Darmesteter declares that ancient Zoroastrianism is, in
     its main lines, the religion of the Median Magi, even though

     Greek, Jewish, and Christian elements.

It is a complicated system of religion, and presupposes a long period of
development. The doctrines are subtle; the ceremonial order of worship,
loaded with strict observances, is interrupted at every moment by laws
prescribing minute details of ritual,* which were only put in practice
by priests and strict devotees, and were unknown to the mass of the
faithful.
</p>
<pre>
     * Renan defined the Avesta as "the Code of a very small
     religious sect; it is a Talmud, a book of casuistry and
     strict observance. I have difficulty in believing that the
     great Persian empire, which, at least in religious matters,
     professed a certain breadth of ideas, could have had a law
     so strict. I think, that had the Persians possessed a sacred
     book of this description, the Greeks must have mentioned
     it."

The primitive, base of this religion is difficult to discern clearly:
but we may recognise in it most of those beings or personifications of
natural phenomena which were the chief objects of worship among all the
ancient nations of Western Asia&mdash;the stars, Sirius, the moon, the sun,
water and fire, plants, animals beneficial to mankind, such as the cow
and the dog, good and evil spirits everywhere present, and beneficent
or malevolent souls of mortal men, but all systematised, graduated, and
reduced to sacerdotal principles, according to the prescriptions of a
powerful priesthood. Families consecrated to the service of the altar
had ended, as among the Hebrews, by separating themselves from the rest
of the nation and forming a special tribe, that of the Magi, which was
the last to enter into the composition of the nation in historic times.
All the Magi were not necessarily devoted to the service of religion,
but all who did so devote themselves sprang from the Magian tribe; the
Avesta, in its oldest form, was the sacred book of the Magi, as well as
that of the priests who handed down their religious tradition under the
various dynasties, native or foreign, who bore rule over Iran.
</p>
<p>
The Creator was described as "the whole circle of the heavens," "the
most steadfast among the gods," for "he clothes himself with the solid
vault of the firmament as his raiment," "the most beautiful, the most
intelligent, he whose members are most harmoniously proportioned; his
body was the light and the sovereign glory, the sun and the moon were
his eyes." The theologians had gradually spiritualised the conception
of this deity without absolutely disconnecting him from the material
universe.

He remained under ordinary circumstances invisible to mortal eyes,
and he could conceal his identity even from the highest gods, but he
occasionally manifested himself in human form. He borrowed in such case
from Assyria the symbol of Assur, and the sculptors depict him with the
upper part of his body rising above that winged disk which is carved in
a hovering attitude on the pediments of Assyrian monuments or stelæ.

     * <i>Ahura</i> is derived from <i>Ahu</i> = <i>Lord</i>: Mazdâo can be
     analysed into the component parts, <i>maz = great</i>, and <i>dâo
     = he who knows</i>. At first the two terms were
     interchangeable, and even in the Gâthas the form Mazda Ahura
     is employed much more often than the form Ahura Mazda. In
     the Achsemenian inscriptions, Auramazdâ is only found as a
     single word, except in an inscription of Xerxes, where the
     two terms are in one passage separated and declined <i>Aurahya
     mazdâha</i>. The form Ormuzd, Ormazd, usually employed by
     Europeans, is that assumed by the name in modern Persian.

     recognised not only among the Achæmenian Persians, but also
     among the Parthians. Darmesteter considers that the earliest
     Achæmenids worshipped Ahura-mazdâ alone, "placing the other
     gods together in a subordinate and anonymous group: May
     Ahura-mazdâ and the other gods protect me."

The most powerful among his ministers were originally nature-gods, such
as the sun, the moon, the earth, the winds, and the waters. The sunny
plains of Persia and Media afforded abundant witnesses of their power,
as did the snow-clad peaks, the deep gorges through which rushed roaring
torrents, and the mountain ranges of Ararat or Taurus, where the
force of the subterranean fires was manifested by so many startling
exhibitions of spontaneous conflagration.* The same spiritualising
tendency which had already considerably modified the essential concept
of Ahura-mazdâ, affected also that of the inferior deities, and tended
to tone down in them the grosser traits of their character. It had
already placed at their head six genii of a superior order, six
ever-active energies, who, after assisting their master at the creation
of the universe, now presided under his guidance over the kingdoms and
forces of nature.**
</p>
<pre>
     * All these inferior deities, heroes, and genii who presided
     over Persia, the royal family, and the different parts of
     the empire, are often mentioned in the most ancient
     classical authors that have come down to us.

     ** The six Amesha-spentas, with their several
     characteristics, are enumerated in a passage of the <i>De
     Iside</i>. This exposition of Persian doctrine is usually
     attributed to Theopompus, from which we may deduce the
     existence of a belief in the Amesha-spentas in the
     Achsemenian period. J. Darmesteter affirms, on the contrary,
     that "the author describes the Zoro-astrianism of his own
     times (the second century A.D.), and quotes Theopompus for a
     special doctrine, that of the periods of the world's life."
     Although this last point is correct, the first part of
     Darmesteter's theory does not seem to me justified by
     investigation. The whole passage of Plutarch is a well-
     arranged composition of uniform style, which may be regarded
     as an exposition of the system described by Theopompus,
     probably in the eighth of his Philippics.

These benevolent and immortal beings&mdash;<i>Amesha-spentas</i>&mdash;were, in the
order of precedence, Vohu-manô (good thought), Asha-vahista (perfect
holiness), Khshathra-vairya (good government), Spenta-armaiti (meek
piety), Haurvatât (health), Ameretât (immortality). Each of them had
a special domain assigned to him in which to display his energy
untrammelled: Vohu-manô had charge of cattle, Asha-vahista of fire,
Khshathra-vairya of metals, Spenta-armaiti of the earth, Haurvatât and
Ameretât of vegetation and of water. They were represented in human
form, either masculine as Vohu-manô and Asha-vahista,* or feminine as
Spenta-armaiti, the daughter and spouse of Ahura-mazdâ, who became
the mother of the first man, Gayomaretan, and, through Gayomaretan,
ancestress of the whole human race.

Sometimes Ahura-mazdâ is himself included among the Amesha-spentas, thus
bringing their number up to seven; sometimes his place is taken by a
certain Sraôsha (obedience to the law), the first who offered sacrifice
and recited the prayers of the ritual. Subordinate to these great
spirits were the Yazatas, scattered by thousands over creation,
presiding over the machinery of nature and maintaining it in working
order. Most of them received no special names, but many exercised wide
authority, and several were accredited by the people with an influence
not less than that of the greater deities themselves. Such Were the
regent of the stars&mdash;Tishtrya, the bull with golden horns, Sirius, the
sparkling one; Mâo, the moon-god; the wind, Vâto; the atmosphere, Vayu,
the strongest of the strong, the warrior with golden armour, who gathers
the storm and hurls it against the demon; Atar, fire under its principal
forms, divine fire, sacred fire, and earthly fire; Vere-thraghna, the
author of war and giver of victory; Aurva-taspa, the son of the waters,
the lightning born among the clouds; and lastly, the spirit of the dawn,
the watchful Mithra, "who, first of the celestial Yazatas, soars above
Mount Hara,* before the immortal sun with his swift steeds, who, first
in golden splendour, passes over the beautiful mountains and casts his
glance benign on the dwellings of the Aryans."**
</p>
<pre>
     * Hara is Haroberezaiti, or Elburz, the mountain over which
     the sun rises, "around which many a star revolves, where
     there is neither night nor darkness, no wind of cold or
     heat, no sickness leading to a thousand kinds of death, nor
     infection caused by the Daôvas, and whose summit is never
     reached by the clouds."

     ** This is the Mithra whose religion became so powerful in
     Alexandrian and Roman times. His sphere of action is defined
     in the Bundehesh.

Mithra was a charming youth of beautiful countenance, his head
surrounded with a radiant halo. The nymph Anâhita was adored under the
form of one of the incarnations of the Babylonian goddess Mylitta, a
youthful and slender female, with well-developed breasts and broad hips,
sometimes represented clothed in furs and sometimes nude.* Like the
foreign goddess to whom she was assimilated, she was the dispenser of
fertility and of love; the heroes of antiquity, and even Ahura-mazdâ
himself, had vied with one another in their worship of her, and she had
lavished her favours freely on all.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The popularity of these two deities was already well
     established at the period we are dealing with, for Herodotus
     mentions Mithra and confuses him with Anâhita.

     ** Her name Ardvî-Sûra Anâhita seems to signify <i>the lofty
     and immaculate power</i>.
</pre>
<p>
The less important Yazatas were hardly to be distinguished from the
innumerable multitude of Fravashis. The Fravasliis are the divine types
of all intelligent beings. They were originally brought into being by
Ahura-mazdâ as a distinct species from the human, but they had allowed
themselves to be entangled in matter, and to be fettered in the bodies
of men, in order to hasten the final destruction of the demons and the
advent of the reign of good.*
</p>

     men is narrated in the Bundehesh.

Once incarnate, a Fravasliis devotes himself to the well-being of the
mortal with whom he is associated; and when once more released from
the flesh, he continues the struggle against evil with an energy whose
efficacy is proportionate to the virtue and purity displayed in life by
the mortal to whom he has been temporarily joined. The last six days
of the year are dedicated to the Fravashis. They leave their heavenly
abodes at this time to visit the spots which were their earthly
dwelling-places, and they wander through the villages inquiring, "Who
wishes to hire us? Who will offer us a sacrifice? Who will make us their
own, welcome us, and receive us with plenteous offerings of food and
raiment, with a prayer which bestows sanctity on him who offers it?" And
if they find a man to hearken to their request, they bless him: "May his
house be blessed with herds of oxen and troops of men, a swift horse
and a strongly built chariot, a man who knoweth how to pray to God, a
chieftain in the council who may ever offer us sacrifices with a hand
filled with food and raiment, with a prayer which bestows sanctity on
him who offers it!" Ahura-mazdâ created the universe, not by the work
of his hands, but by the magic of his word, and he desired to create it
entirely free from defects. His creation, however, can only exist by
the free play and equilibrium of opposing forces, to which he gives
activity: the incompatibility of tendency displayed by these forces, and
their alternations of growth and decay, inspired the Iranians with the
idea that they were the result of two contradictory principles, the one
beneficent and good, the other adverse to everything emanating from the
former.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Spiegel, who at first considered that the Iranian dualism
     was derived from polytheism, and was a preliminary stage in
     the development of monotheism, held afterwards that a rigid
     monotheism had preceded this dualism. The classical writers,
     who knew Zoroastrianism at the height of its glory, never
     suggested that the two principles might be derived from a
     superior principle, nor that they were subject to such a
     principle. The Iranian books themselves nowhere definitely
     affirm that there existed a single principle distinct from
     the two opposing principles.

<p>In opposition to the god of light, they necessarily formed the idea of
a god of darkness, the god of the underworld, who presides over death,
Angrô-mainyus. The two opposing principles reigned at first, each in his
own domain, as rivals, but not as irreconcilable adversaries: they were
considered as in fixed opposition to each other, and as having coexisted
for ages without coming into actual conflict, separated as they were by
the intervening void. As long as the principle of good was content
to remain shut up inactive in his barren glory, the principle of evil
slumbered unconscious in a darkness that knew no beginning; but when
at last "the spirit who giveth increase"&mdash;Spentô-mainyus&mdash;determined to
manifest himself, the first throes of his vivifying activity roused from
inertia the spirit of destruction and of pain, Angrô-mainyus. The heaven
was not yet in existence, nor the waters, nor the earth, nor ox, nor
fire, nor man, nor demons, nor brute beasts, nor any living thing, when
the evil spirit hurled himself upon the light to quench it for ever,
but Ahura-mazdâ had already called forth the ministers of his
will&mdash;Amêsha-spentas, Yazatas, Fravashis&mdash;and he recited the prayer of
twenty-one words in which all the elements of morality are summed up,
the Ahuna-vairya: "The will of the Lord is the rule of good. Let the
gifts of Vohu-manô be bestowed on the works accomplished, at this
moment, for Mazda. He makes Ahura to reign, he who protects the poor."
The effect of this prayer was irresistible: "When Ahura had pronounced
the first part of the formula, Zânak Mînoî, the spirit of destruction,
bowed himself with terror; at the second part he fell upon his knees;
and at the third and last he felt himself powerless to hurt the
creatures of Ahura-mazdâ."*
</p>
<pre>
     * Theopompus was already aware of this alternation of good
     and bad periods. According to the tradition enshrined in the
     first chapter of the Bundehesh, it was the result of a sort
     of compact agreed upon at the beginning by Ahura-mazdâ and
     Angrô-mainyus. Ahura-mazdâ, rearing to be overcome if he
     entered upon the struggle immediately, but sure of final
     victory if he could gain time, proposed to his adversary a
     truce of nine thousand years, at the expiration of which the
     battle should begin. As soon as the compact was made, Angrô-
     mainyus realised that he had been tricked into taking a
     false step, but it was not till after three thousand years
     that he decided to break the truce and open the conflict.
</pre>
<p>
The strife, kindled at the beginning of time between the two gods, has
gone on ever since with alternations of success and defeat; each in turn
has the victory for a regular period of three thousand years; but when
these periods are ended, at the expiration of twelve thousand years,
evil will be finally and for ever defeated. While awaiting this blessed
fulness of time, as Spentô-mainyus shows himself in all that is good
and beautiful, in light, virtue, and justice, so Angrô-mainyus is to be
perceived in all that is hateful and ugly, in darkness, sin, and crime.
Against the six Amesha-spentas he sets in array six spirits of
equal power&mdash;Akem-manô, evil thought; Andra, the devouring fire, who
introduces discontent and sin wherever he penetrates; Sauru, the flaming
arrow of death, who inspires bloodthirsty tyrants, who incites men to
theft and murder; Nâongaithya, arrogance and pride; Tauru, thirst; and
Zairi, hunger.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The last five of these spirits are enumerated in the
     <i>Vendidad</i>, and the first, Akem-manô, is there replaced by
     Nasu, the chief spirit of evil.
</pre>
<p>
To the Yazatas he opposed the Daêvas, who never cease to torment
mankind, and so through all the ranks of nature he set over against each
good and useful creation a counter-creation of rival tendency. "'Like
a fly he crept into' and infected 'the whole universe.' He rendered the
world as dark at full noonday as in the darkest night. He covered the
soil with vermin, with his creatures of venomous bite and poisonous
sting, with serpents, scorpions, and frogs, so that there was not a
space as small as a needle's point but swarmed with his vermin. He smote
vegetation, and of a sudden the plants withered.... He attacked the
flames, and mingled them with smoke and dimness. The planets, with their
thousands of demons, dashed against the vault of heaven and waged war on
the stars, and the universe became darkened like a space which the fire
blackens with its smoke." And the conflict grew ever keener over the
world and over man, of whom the evil one was jealous, and whom he sought
to humiliate.
</p>


<p>
The children of Angrô-mainyus disguised themselves under those monstrous
forms in which the imagination of the Chaldæans had clothed the allies
of Mummu-Tiamât, such as lions with bulls' heads, and the wings and
claws of eagles, which the Achæmenian king combats on behalf of his
subjects, boldly thrusting them through with his short sword. Aêshma of
the blood-stained lance, terrible in wrath, is the most trusted leader
of these dread bands,* the chief of twenty other Daêvas of repulsive
aspect&mdash;Astô-vîdhôtu, the demon of death, who would devote to
destruction the estimable Fravashis;** Apaosha, the enemy of Tishtrya
the wicked black horse, the bringer of drought, who interferes with the
distribution of the fertilising waters; and Bûiti, who essayed to kill
Zoroaster at his birth.***

     ** The name of this demon signifies <i>He who separates the
     bones</i>.

     *** The Greater Bundehesh connects the demon Bûiti with the
     Indian Buddha, and J. Darmestefer seems inclined to accept
     this interpretation. In this case we must either admit that
     the demon Bûiti is of relatively late origin, or that he
     has, in the legend of Zoroaster, taken the place of a demon
     whose name resembled his own closely enough to admit of the
     assimilation.

<p>
The female demons, the Bruges, the Incubi (Yâtus), the Succubi
(Pairîka), the Peris of our fairy tales, mingled familiarly with mankind
before the time of the prophet, and contracted with them fruitful
alliances, but Zoroaster broke up their ranks, and prohibited them
from becoming incarnate in any form but that of beasts; their hatred,
however, is still unquenched, and their power will only be effectually
overthrown at the consummation of time. It is a matter of uncertainty
whether the Medes already admitted the possibility of a fresh
revelation, preparing the latest generations of mankind for the advent
of the reign of good. The traditions enshrined in the sacred books
of Iran announce the coming of three prophets, sons of Zoroaster
&mdash;Ukhshyatereta, Ukhshyatnemô, and Saoshyant* &mdash;who shall bring about
universal salvation.

     * The legend ran that they had been conceived in the waters
     of the lake Kansu. The name Saoshyant signifies <i>the useful
     one, the saviour</i>; Ukshyate-reta, <i>he who malces the good
     increase</i>; Ukshyatnemô, <i>he who makes prayer increase</i>.

<p>
Saoshyant, assisted by fifteen men and fifteen pure women, who have
already lived on earth, and are awaiting their final destiny in a magic
slumber, shall offer the final sacrifice, the virtue of which shall
bring about the resurrection of the dead. "The sovereign light shall
accompany him and his friends, when he shall revivify the world and
ransom it from old age and death, from corruption and decay, and shall
render it eternally living, eternally growing, and master of itself."
The fatal conflict shall be protracted, but the champions of Saoshyant
shall at length obtain the victory. "Before them shall bow Aêshma of the
blood-stained lance and of ominous renown, and Saoshyant shall strike
down the she-demon of the unholy light, the daughter of darkness.
Akem-manô strikes, but Vohu-manô shall strike him in his turn; the lying
word shall strike, but the word of truth shall strike him in his turn;
Haurvatât and Ameretâfc shall strike down hunger and thirst; Haurvatât
and Ameretât shall strike down terrible hunger and terrible thirst."
Angrô-mainyus himself shall be paralysed with terror, and shall be
forced to confess the supremacy of good: he shall withdraw into the
depths of hell, whence he shall never again issue forth, and all the
reanimated beings devoted to the Mazdean law shall live an eternity of
peace and contentment.

<p>
Man, therefore, incessantly distracted between the two principles, laid
wait for by the Baêvas, defended by the Yazatas, must endeavour to act
according to law and justice in the condition in which fate has placed
him. He has been raised up here on earth to contribute as far as in him
lies to the increase of life and of good, and in proportion as he works
for this end or against it, is he the <i>ashavan</i>, the pure, the faithful
one on earth and the blessed one in heaven, or the <i>anashavan</i>, the
lawless miscreant who counteracts purity. The highest grade in the
hierarchy of men belongs of right to the Mage or the <i>âthravan</i>, to the
priest whose voice inspires the demons with fear, or the soldier whose
club despatches the impious, but a place of honour at their side is
assigned to the peasant, who reclaims from the power of Angrô-mainyus the
dry and sterile fields. Among the places where the earth thrives most
joyously is reckoned that "where a worshipper of Ahura-mazdâ builds a
house, with a chaplain, with cattle, with a wife, with sons, with a fair
flock; where man grows the most corn, herbage, and fruit trees; where he
spreads water on a soil without water, and drains off water where
there is too much of it." He who sows corn, sows good, and promotes the
Mazdean faith; "he nourishes the Mazdean religion as fifty men would do
rocking a child in the cradle, five hundred women giving it suck from
their breasts.* When the corn was created the Daêvas leaped, when it
sprouted the Daêvas lost courage, when the stem set the Daêvas wept,
when the ear swelled the Daêvas fled. In the house where corn is
mouldering the Daêvas lodge, but when the corn sprouts, one might say
that a hot iron is being turned round in their mouths." And the reason
of their horror is easily divined: "Whoso eats not, has no power either
to accomplish a valiant work of religion, or to labour with valour,
or yet to beget children valiantly; it is by eating that the universe
lives, and it dies from not eating." The faithful follower of Zoroaster
owes no obligation towards the impious man or towards a stranger,** but
is ever bound to render help to his coreligionist.
</p>
<pre>
     * The original text says in a more enigmatical fashion, "he
     nourishes the religion of Mazdâ as a hundred feet of men and
     a thousand breasts of women might do."

     ** Charity is called in Parsee language, <i>ashô-dâd</i> the
     <i>gift to a pious man</i>, or the <i>gift of piety</i>, and the pious
     man, the <i>ashavan</i>, is by definition the worshipper of
     Ahura-mazdâ alone.
</pre>
<p>
He will give a garment to the naked, and by so doing will wound Zemaka,
the demon of winter. He will never refuse food to the hungry labourer,
under pain of eternal torments, and his charity will extend even to
the brute beasts, provided that they belong to the species created by
Ahura-mazdâ: he has duties towards them, and their complaints, heard
in heaven, shall be fatal to him later on if he has provoked them.
Asha-vahista will condemn to hell the cruel man who has ill-treated the
ox, or allowed his flocks to suffer; and the killing of a hedgehog is
no less severely punished&mdash;for does not a hedgehog devour the ants
who steal the grain? The dog is in every case an especially sacred
animal&mdash;the shepherd's dog, the watchdog, the hunting-dog, even the
prowling dog. It is not lawful to give any dog a blow which renders him
impotent, or to slit his ears, or to cut his foot, without incurring
grave responsibilities in this world and in the next; it is necessary to
feed the dog well, and not to throw bones to him which are too hard, nor
have his food served hot enough to burn his tongue or his throat. For
the rest, the faithful Zoroastrian was bound to believe in his god, to
offer to him the orthodox prayers and sacrifices, to be simple in heart,
truthful, the slave of his pledged word, loyal in his very smallest
acts. If he had once departed from the right way, he could only return
to it by repentance and by purification, accompanied by pious deeds:
to exterminate noxious animals, the creatures of Angrô-mainyus and the
abode of his demons, such as the frog, the scorpion, the serpent or
the ant, to clear the sterile tracts, to restore impoverished land,
to construct bridges over running water, to distribute implements of
husbandry to pions men, or to build them a house, to give a pure and
healthy maiden in marriage to a just man,&mdash;these were so many means of
expiation appointed by the prophet.* Marriage was strictly obligatory,**
and seemed more praiseworthy in proportion as the kinship existing
between the married pair was the closer: not only was the sister united
in marriage to her brother, as in Egypt, but the father to his daughter,
and the mother to her son, at least among the Magi.
</p>
<pre>
     * A passage in the <i>Vendidad</i> even enumerates how many
     noisome beasts must be slain to accomplish one full work of
     expiation&mdash;"to kill 1000 serpents of those who drag
     themselves upon the belly, and 2000 of the other species,
     1000 land frogs or 2000 water frogs, 1000 ants who steal the
     grain," and so on.

     ** The <i>Vendidad</i> says, "And I tell thee, O Spitama
     Zarathustra, the man who has a wife is above him who lives
     in continency;" and, as we have seen in the text, one of
     these forms of expiation consisted in "marrying to a worthy
     man a young girl who has never known a man" (<i>Vendidad</i>, 14,
     § 15). Herodotus of old remarked that one of the chief
     merits in an Iranian was to have many children: the King of
     Persia encouraged fecundity in his realm, and awarded a
     prize each year to that one of his subjects who could boast
     the most numerous progeny.

Polygamy was also encouraged and widely practised: the code imposed no
limit on the number of wives and concubines, and custom was in favour of
a man's having as many wives as his fortune permitted him to maintain.
On the occasion of a death, it was forbidden to burn the corpse, to bury
it, or to cast it into a river, as it would have polluted the fire,
the earth, or the water&mdash;an unpardonable offence. The corpse could be
disposed of in different ways. The Persians were accustomed to cover it
with a thick layer of wax, and then to bury it in the ground: the wax
coating obviated the pollution which direct contact would have brought
upon the soil. The Magi, and probably also strict devotees, following
their example, exposed the corpse in the open air, abandoning it to the
birds or beasts of prey. It was considered a great misfortune if these
respected the body, for it was an almost certain indication of the wrath
of Ahura-mazdâ, and it was thought that the defunct had led an evil
life. When the bones had been sufficiently stripped of flesh, they were
collected together, and deposited either in an earthenware urn or in a
stone ossuary with a cover, or in a monumental tomb either hollowed out
in the heart of the mountain or in the living rock, or raised up
above the level of the ground. Meanwhile the soul remained in the
neighbourhood for three days, hovering near the head of the corpse, and
by the recitation of prayers it experienced, according to its condition
of purity or impurity, as much of joy or sadness as the whole world
experiences. When the third night was past, the just soul set forth
across luminous plains, refreshed by a perfumed breeze, and its good
thoughts and words and deeds took shape before it "under the guise of a
young maiden, radiant and strong, with well-developed bust, noble mien,
and glorious face, about fifteen years of age, and as beautiful as the
most beautiful;" the unrighteous soul, on the contrary, directed its
course towards the north, through a tainted land, amid the squalls of a
pestilential hurricane, and there encountered its past ill deeds, under
the form of an ugly and wicked young woman, the ugliest and most wicked
it had ever seen. The genius Rashnu Razishta, the essentially truthful,
weighed its virtues or vices in an unerring balance, and acquitted or
Condemned it on the impartial testimony of its past life. On issuing
from the judgment-hall, the soul arrived at the approach to the bridge
Cinvaut, which, thrown across the abyss of hell, led to paradise. The
soul, if impious, was unable to cross this bridge, but was hurled down
into the abyss, where it became the slave of Angrô-mainyus. If pure, it
crossed the bridge without difficulty by the help of the angel Sraôsha,
and was welcomed by Vohu-manô, who conducted it before the throne of
Ahura-mazdâ, in the same way as he had led Zoroaster, and assigned to it
the post which it should occupy until the day of the resurrection of the
body.*
</p>
<pre>
     * All this picture of the fate of the soul is taken from the
     <i>Vendidad</i>, where the fate of the just is described, and in
     the <i>Yasht</i>, where the condition of faithful and impious
     souls respectively is set forth on parallel lines. The
     classical authors teach us nothing on this subject, and the
     little they actually say only proves that the Persians
     believed in the immortality of the soul. The main outlines
     of the picture here set forth go back to the times of the
     Achæmenids and the Medes, except the abstract conception of
     the goddess who leads the soul of the dead as an incarnation
     of his good or evil deeds.
</pre>
<p>
The religious observances enjoined on the members of the priestly caste
were innumerable and minute. Ahura-mazdâ and his colleagues had not,
as was the fashion among the Assyrians and Egyptians, either temples or
tabernacles, and though they were represented sometimes under human or
animal forms, and even in some cases on bas-reliefs, yet no one ever
ventured to set up in their sanctuaries those so-called animated or
prophetic statues to which the majority of the nations had rendered or
were rendering their solicitous homage. Altars, however, were erected
on the tops of hills, in palaces, or in the centre of cities, on which
fires were kindled in honour of the inferior deities or of the supreme
god himself.

Two altars were usually set up together, and they are thus found here
and there among the ruins, as at Nakhsh-î-Kustem, the necropolis of
Persepolis, where a pair of such altars exist; these are cut, each out
of a single block, in a rocky mass which rises some thirteen feet above
the level of the surrounding plain. They are of cubic form and
squat appearance, looking like towers flanked at the four corners by
supporting columns which are connected by circular arches; above a
narrow moulding rises a crest of somewhat triangular projections; the
hearth is hollowed out on the summit of each altar.*
</p>
<pre>
     * According to Perrot and Chipiez, "it is not impossible
     that these altars were older than the great buildings of
     Persepolis, and that they were erected for the old Persian
     town which Darius raised to the position of capital."
</pre>
<p>
At Meshed-î-Murgâb, on the site of the ancient Pasargadas, the altars
have disappeared, but the basements on which they were erected are
still visible, as also the flight of eight steps by which they were
approached. Those altars on which burned, a perpetual fire were not
left exposed to the open air: they would have run too great a risk
of contracting impurities, such as dust borne by the wind, flights of
birds, dew, rain, or snow. They were enclosed in slight structures, well
protected by walls, and attaining in some cases considerable dimensions,
or in pavilion-shaped edifices of stone adorned with columns.
</p>


<p>
The sacrificial rites were of long duration, and frequent, and were
rendered very complex by interminable manual acts, ceremonial gestures,
and incantations.

<p>
In cases where the altar was not devoted to maintaining a perpetual
fire, it was kindled when necessary with small twigs previously barked
and purified, and was subsequently fed with precious woods, preferably
cypress or laurel;* care was taken not to quicken the flame by blowing,
for the human breath would have desecrated the fire by merely passing
over it; death was the punishment for any one who voluntarily committed
such a heinous sacrilege. The recognised offering consisted of flowers,
bread, fruit, and perfumes, but these were often accompanied, as in all
ancient religions, by a bloody sacrifice; the sacrifice of a horse was
considered the most efficacious, but an ox, a cow, a sheep, a camel,
an ass, or a stag was frequently offered: in certain circumstances,
especially when it was desired to conciliate the favour of the god of
the underworld, a human victim, probably as a survival of very ancient
rites was preferred.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Pausanias, who witnessed the cult as practised at
     Hierocæsarsea, remarked the curious colour of the ashes
     heaped upon the altar.

     * Most modern writers deny the authenticity of Herodotus'
     account, because a sacrifice of this kind is opposed to the
     spirit of the Magian religion, which is undoubtedly the
     case, as far as the latest form of the religion is
     concerned; but the testimony of Herodotus is so plain that
     the fact itself must be considered as indisputable. We may
     note that the passage refers to the foundation of a city;
     and if we remember how persistent was the custom of human
     sacrifice among ancient races at the foundation of
     buildings, we shall be led to the conclusion that the
     ceremony described by the Greek historian was a survival of
     a very ancient usage, which had not yet fallen entirely into
     desuetude at the Achæmenian epoch.

The king, whose royal position made him the representative of
Ahura-mazdâ on earth, was, in fact, a high priest, and was himself
able to officiate at the altar, but no one else could dispense with the
mediation of the Magi. The worshippers proceeded in solemn procession
to the spot where the ceremony was to take place, and there the priest,
wearing the tiara on his head, recited an invocation in a slow and
mysterious voice, and implored the blessings of heaven on the king
and nation. He then slaughtered the victim by a blow on the head, and
divided it into portions, which he gave back to the offerer without
reserving any of them, for Ahura-mazdâ required nothing but the soul;
in certain cases, the victim was entirely consumed by fire, but more
frequently nothing but a little of the fat and some of the entrails
were taken to feed and maintain the flame, and sometimes even this was
omitted.* Sacrifices were of frequent occurrence. Without mentioning
the extraordinary occasions on which a king would have a thousand bulls
slain at one time,** the Achæmenian kings killed each day a thousand
bullocks, asses, and stags: sacrifice under such circumstances was
another name for butchery, the object of which was to furnish the court
with a sufficient supply of pure meat. The ceremonial bore resemblance
in many ways to that still employed by the modern Zoroastrians of Persia
and India.
</p>
<pre>
     * A relic of this custom may be discerned in the expiatory
     sacrifice decreed in the <i>Vendidad</i>: "He shall sacrifice a
     thousand head of small cattle, and he shall place their
     entrails devoutly on the fire, with libations."

     ** The number 1000 seems to have had some ritualistic
     significance, for it often recurs in the penances imposed on
     the faithful as expiation for their sins: thus it was
     enjoined to slay 1000 serpents, 1000 frogs, 1000 ants who
     steal the grain, 1000 head of small cattle, 1000 swift
     horses, 1000 camels, 1000 brown oxen.
</pre>
<p>
The officiating priest covered his mouth with the bands which fell from
his mitre, to prevent the god from being polluted by his breath; he held
in his hand the baresman, or sacred bunch of tamarisk, and prepared the
mysterious liquor from the haoma plant.* He was accustomed each morning
to celebrate divine service before the sacred fire, not to speak of the
periodic festivals in which he shared the offices with all the members
of his tribe, such as the feast of Mithra, the feast of the Fravashis,**
the feast commemorating the rout of Angrô-mainyus,*** the feast of the
Saksea, during which the slaves were masters of the house.****
</p>
<pre>
     * The drink mentioned by the author of the <i>De Iside</i>, which
     was extracted from the plant Omômi, and which the Magi
     offered to the god of the underworld, is certainly the
     haoma. The rite mentioned by the Greek author, which appears
     to be an incantation against Ahriman, required, it seems, a
     potion in which the blood of a wolf was a necessary
     ingredient: this questionable draught was then carried to a
     place where the sun's rays never shone, and was there
     sprinkled on the ground as a libation.

     ** Menander speaks of this festival as conducted in his own
     times, and tells us that it was called Eurdigan; modern
     authorities usually admit that it goes back to the times of
     the Achæmenids or even beyond.

     *** Agathias says that every worshipper of Ahura-mazdâ is
     enjoined to kill the greatest possible number of animals
     created by Angrô-mainyus, and bring to the Magi the fruits
     of his hunting. Herodotus had already spoken of this
     destruction of life as one of the duties incumbent on every
     Persian, and this gives probability to the view of modern
     writers that the festival went back to the Achæmenian epoch.

     **** The festival of the Sakoa is mentioned by Ctesias. It
     was also a Babylonian festival, and most modern authorities
     conclude from this double use of the name that the festival
     was borrowed from the Babylonians by the Persians, but this
     point is not so certain as it is made out to be, and at any
     rate the borrowing must have taken place very early, for the
     festival was already well established in the Achæmenian
     period.
</pre>
<p>
All the Magi were not necessarily devoted to the priesthood; but
those only became apt in the execution of their functions who had been
dedicated to them from infancy, and who, having received the necessary
instruction, were duly consecrated. These adepts were divided into
several classes, of which three at least were never confounded in their
functions&mdash;the sorcerers, the interpreters of dreams, and the most
venerated sages&mdash;and from these three classes were chosen the ruling
body of the order and its supreme head. Their rule of life was
strict and austere, and was encumbered with a thousand observances
indispensable to the preservation of perfect purity in their persons,
their altars, their victims, and their sacrificial vessels and
implements. The Magi of highest rank abstained from every form of
living thing as food, and the rest only partook of meat under certain
restrictions. Their dress was unpretentious, they wore no jewels, and
observed strict fidelity to the marriage vow;* and the virtues with
which they were accredited obtained for them, from very early times,
unbounded influence over the minds of the common people as well as over
those of the nobles: the king himself boasted of being their pupil, and
took no serious step in state affairs without consulting Ahura-mazdâ or
the other gods by their mediation. The classical writers maintain that
the Magi often cloaked monstrous vices under their apparent strictness,
and it is possible that this was the case in later days, but even then
moral depravity was probably rather the exception than the rule among
them:*** the majority of the Magi faithfully observed the rules of
honest living and ceremonial purity enjoined on them in the books handed
down by their ancestors.
</p>
<pre>
     * Clement of Alexandria assures us that they were strictly
     celibate, but besides the fact that married Magi are
     mentioned several times, celibacy is still considered by
     Zoroastrians an inferior state to that of marriage.

     ** In the Greek period, a spurious epitaph of Darius, son of
     Hystaspes, was quoted, in which the king says of himself, "I
     was the pupil of the Magi."

     *** These accusations are nearly all directed against their
     incestuous marriages: it seems that the classical writers
     took for a refinement of debauchery what really was before
     all things a religious practice.
</pre>
<p>
There is reason to believe that the Magi were all-powerful among the
Medes, and that the reign of Astyages was virtually the reign of the
priestly caste; but all the Iranian states did not submit so patiently
to their authority, and the Persians at last proved openly refractory.
Their kings, lords of Susa as well as of Pasargadse, wielded all the
resources of Elam, and their military power must have equalled, if it
did not already surpass, that of their suzerain lords. Their tribes,
less devoted to the manner of living of the Assyrians and Chaldæans,
had preserved a vigour and power of endurance which the Medes no longer
possessed; and they needed but an ambitious and capable leader, to rise
rapidly from the rank of subjects to that of rulers of Iran, and to
become in a short time masters of Asia. Such a chief they found in
Cyrus,* son of Cambyses; but although no more illustrious name than his
occurs in the list of the founders of mighty empires, the history of no
other has suffered more disfigurement from the imagination of his own
subjects or from the rancour of the nations he had conquered.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The original form of the name is Kûru, Kûrush, with a long
     <i>o</i>, which forces us to reject the proposed connection with
     the name of the Indian hero Kuru, in which the <i>u</i> is short.
     Numerous etymologies of the name Cyrus have been proposed.
     The Persians themselves attributed to it the sense of <i>the
     Sun</i>.

     ** We possess two entirely different versions of the history
     of the origin of Cyrus, but one, that of Herodotus, has
     reached us intact, while that of Ctesias is only known to us
     in fragments from extracts made by Nicolas of Damascus, and
     by Photius. Spiegel and Duncker thought to recognise in the
     tradition followed by Ctesias one of the Persian accounts of
     the history of Cyrus, but Bauer refuses to admit this
     hypothesis, and prefers to consider it as a romance put
     together by the author, according to the taste of his own
     times, from facts partly different from those utilised by
     Herodotus, and partly borrowed from Herodotus himself: but
     it should very probably be regarded as an account of Median
     origin, in which the founder of the Persian empire is
     portrayed in the most unfavourable light. Or perhaps it may
     be regarded as the form of the legend current among the
     Pharnaspids who established themselves as satraps of
     Dascylium in the time of the Achæmenids, and to whom the
     royal house of Cappadocia traced its origin. It is almost
     certain that the account given by Herodotus represents a
     Median version of the legend, and, considering the important
     part played in it by Harpagus, probably that version which
     was current among the descendants of that nobleman. The
     historian Dinon, as far as we can judge from the extant
     fragments of his work, and from the abridgment made by
     Trogus Pompeius, adopted the narrative of Ctesias, mingling
     with it, however, some details taken from Herodotus and the
     romance of Xenophon, the Cyropodia.
</pre>
<p>
The Medes, who could not forgive him for having made them subject to
their ancient vassals, took delight in holding him up to scorn, and not
being able to deny the fact of his triumph, explained it by the adoption
of tortuous and despicable methods. They would not even allow that he
was of royal birth, but asserted that he was of ignoble origin, the son
of a female goatherd and a certain Atradates,* who, belonging to
the savage clan of the Mardians, lived by brigandage. Cyrus himself,
according to this account, spent his infancy and early youth in a
condition not far short of slavery, employed at first in sweeping out
the exterior portions of the palace, performing afterwards the same
office in the private apartments, subsequently promoted to the charge of
the lamps and torches, and finally admitted to the number of the royal
cupbearers who filled the king's goblet at table.
</p>
<pre>
     * According to one of the historians consulted by Strabo,
     Cyrus himself, and not his father, was called Atradates.

When he was at length enrolled in the bodyguard,* he won distinction by
his skill in all military exercises, and having risen from rank to rank,
received command of an expedition against the Cadusians.
</p>
<pre>
     * The tradition reproduced by Dinon narrated that Cyrus had
     begun by serving among the Kavasses, the three hundred
     staff-bearers who accompanied the sovereign when he appeared
     in public, and that he passed next into the royal body-
     guard, and that once having attained this rank, he passed
     rapidly through all the superior grades of the military
     profession.
</pre>
<p>
On the march he fell in with a Persian groom named OEbaras,* who
had been cruelly scourged for some misdeed, and was occupied in the
transportation of manure in a boat: in obedience to an oracle the two
united their fortunes, and together devised a vast scheme for liberating
their compatriots from the Median yoke.
</p>
<pre>
     * This OEbaras whom Ctesias makes the accomplice of Cyrus,
     seems to be an antedated forestallment of theoebaras whom
     the tradition followed by Herodotus knows as master of the
     horse under Darius, and to whom that king owed his elevation
     to the throne.
</pre>
<p>
How Atradates secretly prepared the revolt of the Mardians; how Cyrus
left his camp to return to the court at Ecbatana, and obtained from
Astyages permission to repair to his native country under pretext of
offering sacrifices, but in reality to place himself at the head of the
conspirators; how, finally, the indiscretion of a woman revealed the
whole plot to a eunuch of the harem, and how he warned Astyages in the
middle of his evening banquet by means of a musician or singing-girl,
was frequently narrated by the Median bards in their epic poems, and
hence the story spread until it reached in later times even as far as
the Greeks.*
</p>
<pre>
     * According to Ctesias, it was a singing-girl who revealed
     the existence of the plot to Astyages; according to Dinon,
     it was the bard Angarês. Windischmann has compared this name
     with that of the Vedic guild of singers, the Angira.
</pre>
<p>
Astyages, roused to action by the danger, abandons the pleasures of the
chase in which his activity had hitherto found vent, sets out on the
track of the rebel, wins a preliminary victory on the Hyrba, and kills
the father of Cyrus: some days after, he again overtakes the rebels, at
the entrance to the defiles leading to Pasargadse, and for the second
time fortune is on the point of declaring in his favour, when the
Persian women, bringing back their husbands and sons to the conflict,
urge them on to victory. The fame of their triumph having spread abroad,
the satraps and provinces successfully declared for the conqueror;
Hyrcania, first, followed by the Parthians, the Sakae, and the
Bactrians: Astyages was left almost alone, save for a few faithful
followers, in the palace at Ecbatana. His daughter Amytis and his
son-in-law Spitamas concealed him so successfully on the top of the
palace, that he escaped discovery up to the moment when Cyrus was on
the point of torturing his grandchildren to force them to reveal his
hiding-place: thereupon he gave himself up to his enemies, but was at
length, after being subjected to harsh treatment for a time, set at
liberty and entrusted with the government of a mountain tribe dwelling
to the south-east of the Caspian Sea, that of the Barcanians. Later on
he perished through the treachery of OEbaras, and his corpse was left
unburied in the desert, but by divine interposition relays of lions were
sent to guard it from the attacks of beasts of prey: Cyrus, acquainted
with this miraculous circumstance, went in search of the body and gave
it a magnificent burial.* Another legend asserted, on the contrary,
that Cyrus was closely connected with the royal line of Cyaxares; this
tradition was originally circulated among the great Median families who
attached themselves to the Achaemenian dynasty.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The passage in Herodotus leads Marquart to believe that
     the murder of Astyages formed part of the primitive legend,
     but was possibly attributed to Cambysos, son of Cyrus,
     rather than to OEbaras, the companion of the conqueror's
     early years.

     ** This is the legend as told to Herodotus in Asia Minor,
     probably by the members of the family of Harpagus, which the
     Greek historian tried to render credible by interpreting the
     miraculous incidents in a rationalising manner.

<p>
According to this legend Astyages had no male heirs, and the sceptre
would have naturally descended from him to his daughter Mandanê and
her sons. Astyages was much alarmed by a certain dream concerning his
daughter: he dreamt that water gushed forth so copiously from her
womb as to flood not only Ecbatana, but the whole of Asia, and the
interpreters, as much terrified as himself, counselled him not to give
Mandanê in marriage to a Persian noble of the race of the Achæmenids,
named Cambyses; but a second dream soon troubled the security into which
this union had lulled him: he saw issuing from his daughter's womb a
vine whose branches overshadowed Asia, and the interpreters, being once
more consulted, predicted that a grandson was about to be born to him
whose ambition would cost him his crown. He therefore bade a certain
nobleman of his court, named Harpagus&mdash;he whose descendants preserved
this version of the story of Cyrus&mdash;to seize the infant and put it to
death as soon as its mother should give it birth; but the man, touched
with pity, caused the child to be exposed in the woods by one of the
royal shepherds. A bitch gave suck to the tiny creature, who, however,
would soon have succumbed to the inclemency of the weather, had not the
shepherd's wife, being lately delivered of a still-born son, persuaded
her husband to rescue the infant, whom she nursed with the same
tenderness as if he had been her own child. The dog was, as we know, a
sacred animal among the Iranians: the incident of the bitch seems, then,
to have been regarded by them as an indication of divine intervention,
but the Greeks were shocked by the idea, and invented an explanation
consonant with their own customs. They supposed that the woman had borne
the name of Spakô: Spakô signifying <i>bitch</i> in the language of Media.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus asserts that the child's foster-mother was
     called in Greek <i>Kynô</i>, in Median <i>Spalcô</i>, which comes to
     the same thing, for <i>spaha</i> means <i>bitch</i> in Median. Further
     on he asserts that the parents of the child heard of the
     name of his nurse with joy, as being of good augury; "and,
     in order that the Persians might think that Cyrus had been
     preserved alive by divine agency, <i>they spread abroad the
     report that Cyrus had been suckled by a bitch</i>. And thus
     arose the fable commonly accepted." Trogus Pompeius received
     the original story probably through Dinon, and inserted it
     in his book.
</pre>
<p>
Cyrus grew to boyhood, and being accepted by Mandanê as her son,
returned to the court; his grandfather consented to spare his life, but,
to avenge himself on Harpagus, he caused the limbs of the nobleman's own
son to be served up to him at a feast. Thenceforth Harpagus had but
one idea, to overthrow the tyrant and transfer the crown to the young
prince: his project succeeded, and Cyrus, having overcome Astyages,
was proclaimed king by the Medes as well as by the Persians. The real
history of Cyrus, as far as we can ascertain it, was less romantic. We
gather that Kurush, known to us as Cyrus, succeeded his father Cambyses
as ruler of Anshân about 559 or 558 B.C.,* and that he revolted against
Astyages in 553 or 552 B.C.,** and defeated him. The Median army
thereupon seizing its own leader, delivered him into the hands of the
conqueror: Ecbatana was taken and sacked, and the empire fell at one
blow, or, more properly speaking, underwent a transformation (550 B.C.).
The transformation was, in fact, an internal revolution in which the
two peoples of the same race changed places. The name of the Medes lost
nothing of the prestige which it enjoyed in foreign lands, but that of
the Persians was henceforth united with it, and shared its renown: like
Astyages and his predecessors, Cyrus and his successors reigned equally
over the two leading branches of the ancient Iranian stock, but whereas
the former had been kings of the Medes and Persians, the latter became
henceforth kings of the Persians and Medes.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The length of Cyrus' reign is fixed at thirty years by
     Ctesias, followed by Dinon and Trogus Pompeius, but at
     twenty-nine years by Herodotus, whose computation I here
     follow. Hitherto the beginning of his reign has been made to
     coincide with the fall of Astyages, which was consequently
     placed in 569 or 568 B.C., but the discovery of the <i>Annals
     of Nabonidus</i> obliges us to place the taking of Ecbatana in
     the sixth year of the Babylonian king, which corresponds to
     the year 550 B.C., and consequently to hold that Cyrus
     reckoned his twenty-nine years from the moment when he
     succeeded his father Cambyses.

     ** The inscription on the <i>Rassam Cylinder of Abu-Habba</i>,
     seems to make the fall of the Median king, who was suzerain
     of the Scythians of Harrân, coincide with the third year of
     Nabonidus, or the year 553-2 B.C. But it is only the date of
     the commencement of hostilities between Cyrus and Astyages
     which is here furnished, and this manner of interpreting the
     text agrees with the statement of the Median traditions
     handed down by the classical authors, that three combats
     took place between Astyages and Cyrus before the final
     victory of the Persians.

     *** This equality of the two peoples is indicated by the
     very terms employed by Darius, whom he speaks of them, in
     the <i>Great Inscription of Behistun</i>. He says, for example,
     in connection with the revolt of the false Smerdis, that
     "the deception prevailed greatly in the land, in Persia and
     Media as well as in the other provinces," and further on,
     that "the whole people rose, and passed over from Cambyses
     to him, Persia and Media as well as the other countries." In
     the same way he mentions "the army of Persians and Medes
     which was with him," and one sees that he considered Medes
     and Persians to be on exactly the same footing.
</pre>
<p>
The change effected was so natural that their nearest neighbours, the
Chaldæans, showed no signs of uneasiness at the outset. They confined
themselves to the bare registration of the fact in their annals at the
appointed date, without comment, and Nabonidus in no way deviated from
the pious routine which it had hitherto pleased him to follow. Under
a sovereign so good-natured there was little likelihood of war, at all
events with external foes, but insurrections were always breaking out in
different parts of his territory, and we read of difficulties in Khumê
in the first year of his reign, in Hamath in his second year, and
troubles in Plionicia in the third year, which afforded an opportunity
for settling the Tyrian question. Tyre had led a far from peaceful
existence ever since the day when, from sheer apathy, she had accepted
the supremacy of Nebuchadrezzar.*
</p>
<pre>
     * All these events are known through the excerpt from
     Menander preserved to us by Josephus in his treatise
     <i>Against Apion</i>.
</pre>
<p>
Baal II. had peacefully reigned there for ten years (574-564), but after
his death the people had overthrown the monarchy, and various <i>suffetes</i>
had followed one another rapidly&mdash;Eknibaal ruled two months, Khelbes ten
months, the high priest Abbar three months, the two brothers Mutton
and Gerastratus six years, all of them no doubt in the midst of endless
disturbances; whereupon a certain Baalezor restored the royal dignity,
but only to enjoy it for the space of one year. On his death, the
inhabitants begged the Chaldæans to send them, as a successor to the
crown, one of those princes whom, according to custom, Baal had not long
previously given over as hostages for a guarantee of his loyalty, and
Nergal-sharuzur for this purpose selected from their number Mahar-baal,
who was probably a son of Ithobaal (558-557).* When, at the end of four
years, the death of Mahar-baal left the throne vacant (554-553), the
Tyrians petitioned for his brother Hirôm, and Nabonidus, who was then
engaged in Syria, came south as far as Phoenicia and installed the
prince.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The fragment of Menander does not give the Babylonian
     king's name, but a simple chronological calculation proves
     him to have been Nergal-sharuzur.

     ** <i>Annals of Nabonidus</i>, where mention is made of a certain
     Nabu-makhdan-uzur&mdash;but the reading of the name is uncertain
     &mdash;who seems to be in revolt against the Chaldæans. Floigl has
     very ingeniously harmonised the dates of the Annals with
     those obtained from the fragment of Menander, and has thence
     concluded that the object of the expedition of the third
     year was the enthroning of Hirôm which is mentioned in the
     fragment, and during whose fourteenth year Cyrus became King
     of Babylon.
</pre>
<p>
This took place at the very moment when Cyrus was preparing his
expedition against Astyages; and the Babylonian monarch took advantage
of the agitation into which the Medes were thrown by this invasion, to
carry into execution a project which he had been planning ever since his
accession. Shortly after that event he had had a dream, in which Marduk,
the great lord, and Sin, the light of heaven and earth, had appeared
on either side of his couch, the former addressing him in the following
words: "Nabonidus, King of Babylon, with the horses of thy chariot bring
brick, rebuild E-khul-khul, the temple of Harrân, that Sin, the great
lord, may take up his abode therein." Nabonidus had respectfully pointed
out that the town was in the hands of the Scythians, who were subjects
of the Medes, but the god had replied: "The Scythian of whom thou
speakest, he, his country and the kings his protectors, are no more."
Cyrus was the instrument of the fulfilment of the prophecy. Nabonidus
took possession of Harrân without difficulty, and immediately put the
necessary work in hand. This was, indeed, the sole benefit that he
derived from the changes which were taking place, and it is probable
that his inaction was the result of the enfeebled condition of the
empire. The country over which he ruled, exhausted by the Assyrian
conquest, and depopulated by the Scythian invasions, had not had time to
recover its forces since it had passed into the hands of the Chaldæans;
and the wars which Nebuchadrezzar had been obliged to undertake for the
purpose of strengthening his own power, though few in number and not
fraught with danger, had tended to prolong the state of weakness into
which it had sunk. If the hero of the dynasty who had conquered Egypt
had not ventured to measure his strength with the Median princes, and
if he had courted the friendship not only of the warlike Cyaxares but of
the effeminate Astyages, it would not be prudent for Nabonidus to come
into collision with the victorious new-comers from the heart of Iran.
Chaldsea doubtless was right in avoiding hostilities, at all events so
long as she had to bear the brunt of them alone, but other nations
had not the same motives for exercising prudence, and Lydia was fully
assured that the moment had come for her to again take up the ambitious
designs which the treaty of 585 had forced her to renounce. Alyattes,
relieved from anxiety with regard to the Medes, had confined his
energies to establishing firmly his kingdom in the regions of Asia Minor
extending westwards from the Halys and the Anti-Taurus. The acquisition
of Colophon, the destruction of Smyrna, the alliance with the towns of
the littoral, had ensured him undisputed possession of the valleys of
the Caicus and the Hermus, but the plains of the Maeander in the south,
and the mountainous districts of Mysia in the north, were not yet fully
brought under his sway. He completed the occupation of the Troad and
Mysia about 584, and afterwards made of the entire province an appanage
for Adramyttios, who was either his son or his brother.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The doings of Alyattes in Troas and in Mysia are vouched
     for by the anecdote related by Plutarch concerning this
     king's relations with Pittakos. The founding of Adramyttium
     is attributed to him by Stephen of Byzantium, after
     Aristotle, who made Adramyttios the brother of Croesus.
     Radat gives good reasons for believing that Adramyttios was
     brother to Alyattes and uncle to Crosus, and the same person
     as Adramys, the son of Sadyattes, according to Xanthus of
     Lydia. Radet gives the year 584 for the date of these
     events.

He even carried his arms into Bithynia, where, to enforce his rule, he
built several strongholds, one of which, called Alyatta, commanded
the main road leading from the basin of the Rhyndacus to that of
the Sangarius, skirting the spurs of Olympus.* He experienced some
difficulty in reducing Caria, and did not finally succeed in his efforts
till nearly the close of his reign in 566. Adramyttios was then dead,
and his fief had devolved on his eldest surviving brother or nephew,
Crosus, whose mother was by birth a Carian. This prince had incurred
his father's displeasure by his prodigality, and an influential party
desired that he should be set aside in favour of his brother Pantaleon,
the son of Alyattes by an Ionian. Croesus, having sown his wild oats,
was anxious to regain his father's favour, and his only chance of so
doing was by distinguishing himself in the coming war, if only money
could be found for paying his mercenaries. Sadyattes, the richest banker
in Lydia, who had already had dealings with all the members of the royal
family, refused to make him a loan, but Theokharides of Priênê advanced
him a thousand gold staters, which enabled Crosus to enroll his
contingent at Bphesus, and to be the first to present himself at the
rallying-place for the troops.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Radet places the operations in Bithynia before the Median
     war, towards 594 at the latest. I think that they are more
     probably connected with those in Mysia, and that they form
     part of the various measures taken after the Median war to
     achieve the occupation of the regions west of the Halys.

     ** A mutilated extract from Xanthus of Lydia in Suidas seems
     to carry these events back to the time of the war against
     Priênê, towards the beginning of the reign. The united
     evidence of the accompanying circumstances proves that they
     belong to the time of the old age of Alyattes, and makes it
     very likely that they occurred in 566, the date proposed by
     Radet for the Carian campaign.
</pre>
<p>
Caria was annexed to the kingdom, but the conditions under which the
annexation took place are not known to us;* and Croesus contributed so
considerably to the success of the campaign, that he was reinstated in
popular favour. Alyattes, however, was advancing in years, and was soon
about to rejoin his adversaries Cyaxares and Nebuchadrezzar in Hades.
Like the Pharaohs, the kings of Lydia were accustomed to construct
during their lifetime the monuments in which they were to repose after
death. Their necropolis was situated not far from Sardes, on the shores
of the little lake Gygaea; it was here, close to the resting-place of
his ancestors and their wives, that Alyattes chose the spot for his
tomb,** and his subjects did not lose the opportunity of proving to what
extent he had gained their affections.
</p>
<pre>
     * The fragment of Nicolas of Damascus does not speak of the
     result of the war, but it was certainly favourable, for
     Herodotus counts the Carians among Croesus' subjects.

     ** The only one of these monuments, besides that of
     Alyattes, which is mentioned by the ancients, belonged to
     one of the favourites of Gyges, and was called <i>the Tomb of
     the Courtesan</i>. Strabo, by a manifest error, has applied
     this name <i>to</i> the tomb of Alyattes.
</pre>


<p>
His predecessors had been obliged to finish their work at their own
expense and by forced labour;* but in the case of Alyattes the three
wealthiest classes of the population, the merchants, the craftsmen, and
the courtesans, all united to erect for him an enormous tumulus, the
remains of which still rise 220 feet above the plains of the Hermus.
</p>
<pre>
* This, at least, seems to be the import of the passage in Clearchus of
Soli, where that historian gives an account of the erection of the <i>Tomb
of the Courtesan</i>.

The sub-structure consisted of a circular wall of great blocks of
limestone resting on the solid rock, and it contained in the centre
a vault of grey marble which was reached by a vaulted passage. A huge
mound of red clay and yellowish earth was raised above the chamber,
surmounted by a small column representing a phallus, and by four stelæ
covered with inscriptions, erected at the four cardinal points. It
follows the traditional type of burial-places in use among the old
Asianic races, but it is constructed with greater regularity than most
of them; Alyattes was laid within it in 561, after a glorious reign of
forty-nine years.*

<p>
     * Herodotus gave fifty-seven years' length of reign to
     Alyattes, whilst the chronographers, who go back as far as
     Xanthus of Lydia, through Julius Africanus, attribute to him
     only forty-nine; historians now prefer the latter figures,
     at least as representing the maximum length of reign.

It was wholly due to him that Lydia was for the moment raised to the
level of the most powerful states which then existed on the eastern
shores of the Mediterranean. He was by nature of a violent and
uncontrolled temper, and during his earlier years he gave way to fits of
anger, in which he would rend the clothes of those who came in his way
or would spit in their faces, but with advancing years his character
became more softened, and he finally earned the reputation of being a
just and moderate sovereign. The little that we know of his life reveals
an energy and steadfastness of purpose quite unusual; he proceeded
slowly but surely in his undertakings, and if he did not succeed in
extending his domains as far as he had hoped at the beginning of his
campaigns against the Medes, he at all events never lost any of the
provinces he had acquired. Under his auspices agriculture flourished,
and manufactures attained a degree of perfection hitherto unknown.

None of the vases in gold, silver, or wrought-iron, which he dedicated

us, but at rare intervals ornaments of admirable workmanship are found
in the Lydian tombs. Those now in the Louvre exhibit, in addition to
human figures somewhat awkwardly treated, heads of rams, bulls, and
griffins of a singular delicacy and faithfulness to nature. These
examples reveal a blending of Grecian types and methods of production
with those of Egypt or Chaldæa, the Hellenic being predominant,* and
the same combination of heterogeneous elements must have existed in the
other domains of industrial art&mdash;-in the dyed and embroidered stuffs,**
the vases,*** and the furniture.****

     one of those found represented, with the same decoration, on

Lydia, inheriting the traditions of Phrygia, and like that state
situated on the border of two worlds, allied moreover with Egypt as well
as Babylon, and in regular communication with the Delta, borrowed from
each that which fell in with her tastes or seemed likely to be most
helpful to her in her commercial relations. As the country produced
gold in considerable quantities, and received still more from extraneous
sources, the precious metal came soon to be employed as a means of
exchange under other conditions than those which had hitherto prevailed.
Besides acting as commission agents and middle-men for the disposal
of merchandise at Sardes, Ephesus, Miletus, Clazomenaa, and all the
maritime cities, the Lydians performed at the same time the functions
of pawnbrokers, money-changers, and bankers, and they were ready to
make loans to private individuals as well as to kings. Obliged by the
exigencies of their trade to cut up the large gold ingots into sections
sufficiently small to represent the smallest values required in daily
life, they did not at first impress upon these portions any stamp as
a guarantee of the exact weight or the purity of the metal; they were
estimated like the <i>tabonu</i> of the Egyptians, by actual weighing on the
occasion of each business transaction.

The idea at length occurred to them to impress each of these pieces with
a common stamp, serving, like the trade-marks employed by certain guilds
of artisans, to testify at once to their genuineness and their exact
weight: in a word, they were the inventors of money. The most ancient
coinage of their mint was like a flattened sphere, more or less ovoid,
in form: it consisted at first of electrum, and afterwards of smelted
gold, upon which parallel striae or shallow creases were made by a
hammer. There were two kinds of coinage, differing considerably from
each other; one consisted of the heavy stater, weighing about 14.20
grammes, perhaps of Phoenician origin, the other of the light stater, of
some 10.80 grammes in weight, which doubtless served as money for
the local needs of Lydia: both forms were subdivided into pieces
representing respectively the third, the sixth, the twelfth, and the
twenty-fourth of the value of the original.
</p>

<p>
The stamp which came to be impressed upon the money was in relief, and
varied with the banker; * when political communities began to follow the
example of individuals, it also bore the name of the city where it was
minted.
</p>
<pre>
     * [The best English numismatists do not agree with M.
     Babelon's "banker" theory. Cf. Barclay V. Head, <i>Historia
     Nummorum</i>, p. xxxiv.&mdash;-Tr.]
</pre>
<p>
The type of impression once selected, was little modified for fear of
exciting mistrust among the people, but it was more finely executed and
enlarged so as to cover one of the faces, that which we now call the
<i>obverse</i>. Several subjects entered into the composition of the design,
each being impressed by a special punch: thus in the central concavity
we find the figure of a running fox, emblem of Apollo Bassareus, and
in two similar depressions, one above and the other below the central,
appear a horse's or stag's head, and a flower with four petals. Later
on the design was simplified, and contained only one, or at most two
figures&mdash;a hare squatting under a tortuous climbing plant, a roaring
lion crouching with its head turned to the left, the grinning muzzle of
a lion, the horned profile of an antelope or mouflon sheep: rosettes and
flowers, included within a square depression, were then used to replace
the stria and irregular lines of the reverse. These first efforts were
without inscriptions; it was not long, however, before there came to be
used, in addition to the figures, legends, from which we sometimes
learn the name of the banker; we read, for instance, "I am the mark of
Phannes," on a stater of electrum struck at Ephesus, with a stag grazing
on the right. We are ignorant as to which of the Lydian kings first made
use of the new invention, and so threw into circulation the gold and
electrum which filled his treasury to overflowing. The ancients say it
was Gyges, but the Gygads of their time cannot be ascribed to him; they
were, without any doubt, simply ingots marked with the stamp of the
banker of the time, and were attributed to Gyges either out of pure
imagination or by mistake.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The gold of Gyges is known to us through a passage in
     Pollux. Fr. Lenormant attributed to Gyges the coins which
     Babelon restores to the banks of Asia Minor. Babelon sees in
     the Gygads only "ingots of gold, struck <i>possibly</i> in the
     name of Gyges, capable of being used as coin, doubtless
     representing a definitely fixed weight, but still lacking
     that ultimate perfection which characterises the coinage of
     civilised peoples: from the standpoint of circulation in the
     market their shape was defective and inconvenient; their
     subdivision did not extend to such small fractions as to
     make all payments easy; they were too large and too dear for
     easy circulation through many hands."
</pre>
<p>
The same must be said of the pieces of money which have been assigned
to his successors, and, even when we find on them traces of writing, we
cannot be sure of their identification; one legend which was considered
to contain the name of Sadyattes has been made out, without producing
conviction, as involving, instead, that of Clazomenæ. There is no
certainty until after the time of Alyattes, that is, in the reign of
Croesus. It is, as a fact, to this prince that we owe the fine gold and
silver coins bearing on the obverse a demi-lion couchant confronting
a bull treated similarly.* The two creatures appear to threaten one
another, and the introduction of the lion recalls a tradition regarding
the city of Sardes; it may represent the actual animal which was alleged
to have been begotten by King Meles of one of his concubines, and which
he caused to be carried solemnly round the city walls to render them
impregnable.
</p>
<p>
Croesus did not succeed to the throne of his father without trouble. His
enemies had not laid down their arms after the Carian campaign, and they
endeavoured to rid themselves of him by all the means in use at Oriental
courts. The Ionian mother of his rival furnished the slave who kneaded
the bread with poison, telling her to mix it with the dough, but the
woman revealed the intended crime to her master, who at once took the
necessary measures to frustrate the plot; later on in life he dedicated
in the temple of Delphi a statue of gold representing the faithful
bread-maker.** The chief of the rival party seems to have been
Sadyattes, the banker from whom Croesus had endeavoured to borrow money
at the beginning of his career, but several of the Lydian nobles, whose
exercise of feudal rights had been restricted by the growing authority
of the Mermnado, either secretly or openly gave their adhesion to
Pantaleon, among them being Glaucias of Sidênê; the Greek cities, always
ready to chafe at authority, were naturally inclined to support a
claimant born of a Greek mother, and Pindarus the tyrant of Ephesus, and
grandson of the Melas who had married the daughter of Gyges, joined the
conspirators. 
</p>
<pre>
     * Lenormant ascribed an issue of coins without inscriptions
     to the kings Ardys, Sadyattes, and Alyattes, but this has
     since been believed not to have been their work.

     ** Herodotus mentions the statue of the bread-maker, giving
     no reason why Crosus dedicated it. The author quoted by
     Plutarch would have it that in revenge he made his half-
     brothers eat the poisoned bread.

<p>
As soon as Alyattes was dead, Crosus, who was kept informed by his spies
of their plans, took action with a rapidity which disconcerted his
adversaries. It is not known what became of Pantaleon, whether he was
executed or fled the country, but his friends were tortured to death or
had to purchase their pardon dearly. Sadyattes was stretched on a rack
and torn with carding combs.* Glaucias, besieged in his fortress of
Sidênê, opened its gates after a desperate resistance; the king
demolished the walls, and pronounced a solemn curse on those who should
thereafter rebuild them. Pindarus, summoned to surrender, refused, but
as he had not sufficient troops to defend the entire city, he evacuated
the lower quarters, and concentrated all his forces on the defence of
the citadel; he refused to open negotiations until after the fall of a
tower at the moment when a practicable breach had been made, and
succeeded in obtaining an honourable capitulation for himself and his
people by a ruse.
</p>
<pre>
     * The history of Sadyattes and of his part in the conspiracy
     results from points of agreement which have been established
     between various passages in Herodotus and in Nicolas of
     Damascus, where the person is sometimes named and sometimes
     not.
</pre>
<p>
He dedicated the town to Artemis, and by means of a rope connected
the city walls with the temple, which stood nearly a mile away in
the suburbs, and then entreated for peace in the name of the goddess.
Croesus was amused at the artifice, and granted favourable conditions to
the inhabitants, but insisted on the expulsion of the tyrant. The latter
bowed before the decree, and confiding the care of his children and
possessions to his friend Pasicles, left for the Peloponnesus with his
retinue. Bphesus up to this time had been a kind of allied principality,
whose chiefs, united to the royal family of Lydia by marriages from
generation to generation, recognised the nominal suzerainty of the
reigning king rather than his effective authority. It was in fact
a species of protectorate, which, while furthering the commercial
interests of Lydia, satisfied at the same time the passion of the Greek
cities for autonomy. Croesus, encouraged by his first success, could
not rest contented with such a compromise. He attacked, successively,
Miletus and the various Ionian, Æolian, and Dorian communities of
the littoral, and brought them all under his sway, promising on their
capitulation that their local constitutions should be respected if they
became direct dependencies of his empire. He placed garrisons in such
towns as were strategically important for him to occupy, but everywhere
else he razed to the ground the fortresses and ramparts which might
afford protection to his enemies in case of rebellion, compelling the
inhabitants to take up their abode on the open plain where they could
not readily defend themselves.* The administration of the affairs of
each city was entrusted to either a wealthy citizen, or an hereditary
tyrant, or an elected magistrate, who was held responsible for its
loyalty; the administrator paid over the tribute to the sovereign's
treasurers, levied the specified contingent and took command of it in
time of war, settled any quarrels which might occur, and was empowered,
when necessary, to exile turbulent and ambitious persons whose words
or actions appeared to him to be suspicious. Croesus treated with
generosity those republics which tendered him loyal obedience, and
affected a special devotion to their gods. He gave a large number of
ex-voto offerings to the much-revered sanctuary of Bran-chidse, in the
territory of Miletus; he dedicated some golden heifers at the Artemision
of Ephesus, and erected the greater number of the columns of that temple
at his own expense.**
</p>
<pre>
     * He treated thus the Ephesians and the Ilians.

     ** The fragments of columns brought from this temple by Wood
     and preserved in the British Museum have on one of the bases
     the remains of an inscription confirming the testimony of
     Herodotus.
</pre>
<p>
At one time in his career he appears to have contemplated extending his
dominion over the Greek islands, and planned, as was said, the equipment
of a fleet, but he soon acknowledged the imprudence of such a project,
and confined his efforts to strengthening his advantageous position on
the littoral by contracting alliances with the island populations and
with the nations of Greece proper.*
</p>
<pre>
     * He seems to have been deterred from his project by a
     sarcastic remark made, as some say, by Pittakos the
     Mitylenian, or according to others, by Bias of Priênê.
</pre>
<p>
Following the diplomacy of his ancestors, he began by devoting himself
to the gods of the country, and took every pains to gain the good graces
of Apollo of Delphi. He dispensed his gifts with such liberality that
neither his contemporaries nor subsequent generations grew weary
of admiring it. On one occasion he is said to have sacrificed three
thousand animals, and burnt, moreover, on the pyre the costly contents
of a palace&mdash;couches covered with silver and gold, coverlets and robes
of purple, and golden vials. His subjects were commanded to contribute
to the offering, and he caused one hundred and seventeen hollow
half-bricks to be cast of the gold which they brought him for this
purpose. These bricks were placed in regular layers within the treasury
at Delphi where the gifts of Lydia from the time of Alyattes were
deposited, and the top of the pile was surmounted by a lion of fine
gold of such a size that the pedestal and statue together were worth
£1,200,000 of our present money. These, however, formed only a tithe of
his gifts; many of the objects dedicated by him were dispersed half a
century (548 B.C.) later when the temple was burnt, and found their
way into the treasuries of the Greek states which enjoyed the favour
of Apollo&mdash;among them being an enormous gold cup sent to Clazomeme, and
four barrels of silver and two bowls, one of silver and one of gold,
sent to the Corinthians. The people at Delphi, as well as their god,
participated in the royal largesse, and Croesus distributed to them
the sum of two staters per head. No doubt their gratitude led them by
degrees to exaggerate the total of the benefits showered upon them,
especially as time went on and their recollection of the king became
fainter; but even when we reduce the number of the many gifts which
they attributed to him, we are still obliged to acknowledge that they
surpassed anything hitherto recorded, and that they produced throughout
the whole of Greece the effect that Croesus had desired. The oracle
granted to him and to the Lydians the rights of citizenship in
perpetuity, the privilege of priority in consulting it before all
comers, precedence for his legates over other foreign embassies, and a
place of honour at the games and at all religious ceremonies. It was,
in fact, the admission of Lydia into the Hellenic concert, and the
offerings which Croesus showered upon the sanctuaries of lesser
fame&mdash;that of Zeus at Dodona, of Amphiaraos at Oropos, of Trophonios at
Lebadsea, on the oracle of Abee in Phocis, and on the Ismenian Apollo
at Thebes&mdash;secured a general approval of the act. Political alliances
contracted with the great families of Athens, the Alcmonidæ and
Eupatridæ,* with the Cypselidæ of, Corinth,** and with the Heraclidæ of
Sparta,*** completed the policy of bribery which Croesus had inaugurated
in the sacerdotal republics, with the result that, towards 548, being in
the position of uncontested patron of the Greeks of Asia, he could count
upon the sympathetic neutrality of the majority of their compatriots in
Europe, and on the effective support of a smaller number of them in
the event of his being forced into hostilities with one or other of his
Asiatic rivals.
</p>
<pre>
     * Traditions as to Crcesus' relations with Alcrnseon are
     preserved by Herodotus. The king compelled the inhabitants of
     Lampsacus, his vassals, to release the elder Miltiades, whom
     they had taken prisoner, and thus earned the gratitude of
     the Eupatridæ.

     ** Alyattes had been the ally of Periander, as is proved by
     an anecdote in Herodotus. This friendship continued under
     Crosus, for after the fall of the monarchy, when the special
     treasuries of Lydia were suppressed, the ex-voto offerings
     of the Lydian kings were deposited in the treasury of
     Corinth.

     *** According to Theopompus, the Lacedaemonians, wishing to
     gild the face of the statue of the Amyclsean, Apollo, and
     finding no gold in Greece, consulted the Delphian
     prophetess: by her advice they sent to Lydia to buy the
     precious metal from Croesus.
</pre>
<p>
This, however, constituted merely one side of his policy, and the
negotiations which he carried on with his western neighbours were
conducted simultaneously with his wars against those of the east.
Alyattes had asserted his supremacy over the whole of the country on the
western side of the Halys, but it was of a very vague kind, having no
definite form, and devoid of practical results as far as several of the
districts in the interior were concerned. Croesus made it a reality, and
in less than ten years all the peoples contained within it, the Lycians
excepted&mdash;Mysians, Phrygians, Mariandynians, Paphlagonians, Thynians,
Bithynians, and Pamphylians&mdash;had rendered him homage. In its
constitution his empire in no way differed from those which at that time
shared the rule of Western Asia; the number of districts administered
directly by the sovereign were inconsiderable, and most of the states
comprised in it preserved their autonomy. Phrygia had its own princes,
who were descendants of Midas,* and in the same way Caria and Mysia
also retained theirs; but these vassal lords paid tribute and furnished
contingents to their liege of Sardes, and garrisons lodged in their
citadels as well as military stations or towns founded in strategic
positions, such as Prusa** in Bithynia, Cibyra, Hyda, Grimenothyræ, and
Temenothyræ,*** kept strict watch over them, securing the while free
circulation for caravans or individual merchants throughout the whole
country. Croesus had achieved his conquest just as Media was tottering
to its fall under the attacks of the Persians.
</p>
<pre>
     * This is proved by the history of the Prince Adrastus in
     Herodotus. Herodotus probably alluded to this colonisation
     by Crcesus, when he said that the Mysians of Olympus were
     descendants of Lydian colonists.

     ** Strabo merely says that the Kibyrates were descended from
     the Lydians who dwelt in Cabalia; since Croesus was, as far
     as we know, the only Lydian king who ever possessed this
     part of Asia, Radet, with good reason, concludes that Kibyra
     was colonised by him.

     *** Radet has given good reasons for believing that at least
     some of these towns were enlarged and fortified by Croesus.
</pre>
<p>
Their victory placed the Lydian king in a position of great perplexity,
since it annulled the treaties concluded after the eclipse of 585, and
by releasing him from the obligations then contracted, afforded him an
opportunity of extending the limits within which his father had confined
himself. Now or never was the time for crossing the Halys in order to
seize those mineral districts with which his subjects had so long had
commercial relations; on the other hand, the unexpected energy of which
the Persians had just given proof, their bravery, their desire for
conquest, and the valour of their leader, all tended to deter him from
the project: should he be victorious, Cyrus would probably not rest
contented with tke annexation of a few unimportant districts or the
imposition of a tribute, but would treat his adversary as he had
Astyages, and having dethroned him, would divide Lydia into departments
to be ruled by one or other of his partisans. Warlike ideas,
nevertheless, prevailed at the court of Sardes, and, taking all into
consideration, we cannot deny that they had reason on their side. The
fall of Ecbatana had sealed the fate of Media proper, and its immediate
dependencies had naturally shared the fortunes of the capital; but the
more distant provinces still wavered, and they would probably attempt
to take advantage of the change of rule to regain their liberty. Cyrus,
obliged to take up arms against them, would no longer have his entire
forces at his disposal, and by attacking him at that juncture it might
be possible to check his power before it became irresistible. Having
sketched out his plan of campaign, Croesus prepared to execute it with
all possible celerity. Egypt and Chaldæa, like himself, doubtless felt
themselves menaced; he experienced little difficulty in persuading them
to act in concert with him in face of the common peril, and he obtained
from both Amasis and Nabonidus promises of effective co-operation. At
the same time he had recourse to the Greek oracles, and that of
Delphi was instrumental in obtaining for him a treaty of alliance and
friendship with Sparta. Negotiations had been carried on so rapidly,
that by the end of 548 all was in readiness for a simultaneous movement;
Sparta was equipping a fleet, and merely awaited the return of the
favourable season to embark her contingent; Egypt had already despatched
hers, and her Cypriot vassals were on the point of starting, while bands
of Thracian infantry were marching to reinforce the Lydian army. These
various elements represented so considerable a force of men, that, had
they been ranged on a field of battle, Cyrus would have experienced
considerable difficulty in overcoming them. An unforeseen act of
treachery obliged the Lydians to hasten their preparations and commence
hostilities before the moment agreed on. Eurybatos, an Ephesian, to whom
the king had entrusted large sums of money for the purpose of raising
mercenaries in the Peloponnesus, fled with his gold into Persia, and
betrayed the secret of the coalition. The Achaemenian sovereign did not
hesitate to forestall the attack, and promptly assumed the offensive.
The transport of an army from Ecbatana to the middle course of the
Halys would have been a long and laborious undertaking, even had it kept
within the territory of the empire; it would have necessitated crossing
the mountain groups of Armenia at their greatest width, and that at a
time when the snow was still lying deep upon the ground and the torrents
were swollen and unfordable. The most direct route, which passed through
Assyria and the part of Mesopotamia south of the Masios, lay for the
most part in the hands of the Chaldæans, but their enfeebled condition
justified Cyrus's choice of it, and he resolved, in the event of their
resistance, to cut his way through sword in hand. He therefore bore
down upon Arbela by the gorges of Rowandîz in the month Nisan, making as
though he were bound for Karduniash; but before the Babylonians had time
to recover from their alarm at this movement, he crossed the river not
far from Nineveh and struck into Mesopotamia. He probably skirted the
slopes of the Masios, overcoming and killing in the month Iyyâr
some petty king, probably the ruler of Armenia,* and debouched into
Cappadocia. This province was almost entirely in the power of the enemy;
Nabonidus had despatched couriers by the shortest route in order to warn
his ally, and if necessary to claim his promised help.
</p>
<pre>
     * Ploigl, who was the first to refer a certain passage in
     the <i>Annals of Nabonidus</i> to the expedition against Croesus,
     restored Is[parda] as the name of the country mentioned, and
     saw even the capture of Sardes in the events of the month
     Iyyâr, in direct contradiction to the Greek tradition. The
     connection between the campaign beyond the Tigris and the
     Lydian war seems to me incontestable, but the Babylonian
     chronicler has merely recorded the events which affected
     Babylonia. Cyrus' object was both to intimidate Nabonidus
     and also to secure possession of the most direct, and at the
     same time the easiest, route: by cutting across Mesopotamia,
     he avoided the difficult marches in the mountainous
     districts of Armenia. Perhaps we should combine, with the
     information of the <i>Annals</i>, the passage of Xenophon, where
     it is said that the Armenians refused tribute and service to
     the King of Persia: Cyrus would have punished the rebels on
     his way, after crossing the Euphrates.
</pre>
<p>
Croesus, when he received them, had with him only the smaller portion of
his army, the Lydian cavalry, the contingents of his Asiatic subjects,
and a few Greek veterans, and it would probably have been wiser to defer
the attack till after the disembarkation of the Lacedaemonians; but
hesitation at so critical a moment might have discouraged his followers,
and decided his fate before any action had taken place. He therefore
collected his troops together, fell upon the right bank of the Halys,*
devastated the country, occupied Pteria and the neighbouring towns,
and exiled the inhabitants to a distance. He had just completed the
subjection of the White Syrians when he was met by an emissary from the
Persians; Cyrus offered him his life, and confirmed his authority on
condition of his pleading for mercy and taking the oath of vassalage.**
Croesus sent a proud refusal, which was followed by a brilliant
victory, after which a truce of three months was concluded between the
belligerents.***
</p>
<pre>
     * On this point Herodotus tells a current story of his time:
     Thaïes had a trench dug behind the army, which was probably
     encamped in one of the bends made by the Halys; he then
     diverted the stream into this new bed, with the result that
     the Lydians found themselves on the right bank of the river
     without having had the trouble of crossing it.

     ** Nicolas of Damascus records that Cyrus, after the capture
     of Sardes, for a short time contemplated making Croesus a
     vassal king, or at least a satrap of Lydia.

     *** We have two very different accounts of this campaign,
     viz. that of Herodotus, and that of Polyonus. According to
     Herodotus, Croesus gave battle only once in Pteria, with
     indecisive result, and on the next day quietly retired to
     his kingdom, thinking that Cyrus would not dare to pursue
     him. According to Polyonus, Croesus, victorious in a first
     engagement owing to a more or less plausible military
     stratagem, consented to a truce, but on the day after was
     completely defeated, and obliged to return to his kingdom
     with a routed army. Herodotus' account of the fall of
     Croesus and of Sardes, borrowed partly from a good written
     source, Xanthus or Charon of Lampsacus, partly from the
     tradition of the Harpagidse, seems to have for its object
     the soothing of the vanity both of the Persians and of the
     Lydians, since, if the result of the war could not be
     contested, the issue of the battle was at least left
     uncertain. If he has given a faithful account, no one can
     understand why Croesus should have retired and ceded White
     Syria to a rival who had never conquered him. The account
     given by Polysenus, in spite of the improbability of some of
     its details, comes from a well-informed author: the defeat
     of the Lydians in the second battle explains the retreat of
     Crcesus, who is without excuse in Herodotus' version of the
     affair. Pompeius Trogus adopted a version similar to that of
     Polysenus.
</pre>
<p>
Cyrus employed the respite in attempting to win over the Greek cities
of the littoral, which he pictured to himself as nursing a bitter
hatred against the Mermnadæ; but it is to be doubted if his emissaries
succeeded even in wresting a declaration of neutrality from the
Milesians; the remainder, Ionians and Æolians, all continued faithful
to their oaths.* On the resumption of hostilities, the tide of fortune
turned, and the Lydians were crushed by the superior forces of the
Persians and the Medes; Crcesus retired under cover of night, burning
the country as he retreated, to prevent the enemy from following him,
and crossed the Halys with the remains of his battalions. The season was
already far advanced; he thought that the Persians, threatened in the
rear by the Babylonian troops, would shrink from the prospect of a
winter campaign, and he fell back upon Sardes without further lingering
in Phrygia. But Nabonidus did not feel himself called upon to show the
same devotion that his ally had evinced towards him, or perhaps the
priests who governed in his name did not permit him to fulfil his
engagements.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus makes the attempted corruption of the Ionians to
     date from the beginning of the war, even before Cyrus took
     the field.

     ** The author followed by Pompeius Trogus has alone
     preserved the record of this treaty. The fact is important
     as explaining Croesus' behaviour after his defeat, but
     Schubert goes too far when he re-establishes on this ground
     an actual campaign of Cyrus against Babylon: Radet has come
     back to the right view in seeing only a treaty made with
     Nabonidus.
</pre>
<p>
As soon as peace was proposed, he accepted terms, without once
considering the danger to which the Lydians were exposed by his
defection. The Persian king raised his camp as soon as all fear of an
attack to rearward was removed, and, falling upon defenceless Phrygia,
pushed forward to Sardes in spite of the inclemency of the season. No
movement could have been better planned, or have produced such
startling results. Croesus had disbanded the greater part of his feudal
contingents, and had kept only his body-guard about him, the remainder
of his army&mdash;natives, mercenaries, and allies&mdash;having received orders
not to reassemble till the following spring. The king hastily called
together all his available troops, both Lydians and foreigners,
and confronted his enemies for the second time. Even under these
unfavourable conditions he hoped to gain the advantage, had his cavalry,
the finest in the world, been able to take part in the engagement. But
Cyrus had placed in front of his lines a detachment of camels, and the
smell of these animals so frightened the Lydian horses that they snorted
and refused to charge.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus' mention of the use of camels is confirmed, with
     various readings, by Xenophon, by Polysenus, and by Ælian;
     their employment does not necessarily belong to a legendary
     form of the story, especially if we suppose that the camel,
     unknown before in Asia Minor, was first introduced there by
     the Persian army. The site of the battle is not precisely
     known. According to Herodotus, the fight took place in the
     great plain before Sardes, which is crossed by several small
     tributaries of the Hermus, amongst others the Hyllus. Radet
     recognises that the Hyllus of Herodotus is the whole or part
     of the stream now called the Kusu-tchaî, and he places the
     scene of action near the township of Adala, which would
     correspond with Xenophon's Thymbrara. This continues to be
     the most likely hypothesis. After the battle Croesus would
     have fled along the Hermus towards Sardes. Xenophon's story
     is a pure romance.
</pre>
<p>
Croesus was again worsted on the confines of the plain of the Hermus,
and taking refuge in the citadel of Sardes, he despatched couriers to
his allies in Greece and Egypt to beg for succour without delay. The
Lacedaemonians hurried on the mobilisation of their troops, and their
vessels were on the point of weighing anchor, when the news arrived
that Sardes had fallen in the early days of December, and that Croesus
himself was a prisoner.* How the town came to be taken, the Greeks
themselves never knew, and their chroniclers have given several
different accounts of the event.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Radet gives the date of the capture of Sardes as about
     November 15, 546; but the number and importance of the
     events occurring between the retreat of Croesus and the
     decisive catastrophe&mdash;the negotiations with Babylon, the
     settling into winter quarters, the march of Cyrus across
     Phrygia&mdash;must have required a longer time than Radet allots
     to them in his hypothesis, and I make the date a month
     later.

     ** Ctesias and Xenophon seem to depend on Herodotus, the
     former with additional fabulous details concerning his
     OEbaras, Cyrus' counsellor, which show the probable origin
     of his additions. Polysenus had at his disposal a different
     story, the same probably that he used for his account of the
     campaign in Cappadocia, for in it can be recognised the wish
     to satisfy, within possible limits, the pride of the
     Lydians: here again the decisive success is preceded by a
     check given to Cyrus and a three months' truce.
</pre>
<p>
The least improbable is that found in Herodotus. The blockade had
lasted, so he tells us, fourteen days, when Cyrus announced that he
would richly reward the first man to scale the walls. Many were tempted
by his promises, but were unsuccessful in their efforts, and their
failure had discouraged all further attempts, when a Mardian soldier,
named Hyreades, on duty at the foot of the steep slopes overlooking the
Tmolus, saw a Lydian descend from rock to rock in search of his helmet
which he had lost, and regain the city by the same way without any great
difficulty. He noted carefully the exact spot, and in company with a few
comrades climbed up till he reached the ramparts; others followed, and
taking the besieged unawares, they opened the gates to the main body of
the army.*
</p>
<pre>
     * About three and a half centuries later Sardes was captured
     in the same way by one of the generals of Antiochus the
     Great.
</pre>
<p>
Croesus could not bear to survive the downfall of his kingdom: he
erected a funeral pyre in the courtyard of his palace, and took up his
position on it, together with his wives, his daughters, and the noblest
youths of his court, surrounded by his most precious possessions.
He could cite the example of more than one vanquished monarch of the
ancient Asiatic world in choosing such an end, and one of the fabulous
ancestors of his race, Sandon-Herakles, had perished after this fashion
in the midst of the flames. Was the sacrifice carried out? Everything
leads us to believe that it was, but popular feeling could not be
resigned to the idea that a prince who had shown such liberality towards
the gods in his prosperity should be abandoned by them in the time
of his direst need. They came to believe that the Lydian monarch had
expiated by his own defeat the crime by the help of which his ancestor
Gyges had usurped the throne. Apollo had endeavoured to delay the
punishment till the next generation, that it might fall on the son of
his votary, but he had succeeded in obtaining from fate a respite of
three years only. Even then he had not despaired, and had warned Croesus
by the voice of the oracles. They had foretold him that, in crossing the
Halys, the Lydians ^would destroy a great empire, and that their power
would last till the day when a mule should sit upon the throne of Media.
Croesus, blinded by fate, could not see that Cyrus, who was of mixed
race, Persian by his father and Median by his mother, was the predicted
mule. He therefore crossed the Halys, and a great empire fell, but it
was his own. At all events, the god might have desired to show that to
honour his altars and adorn his temple was in itself, after all, the
best of treasures. "When Sardes, suffering the vengeance of Zeus, was
conquered by the army of the Persians, the god of the golden sword,
Apollo, was the guardian of Croesus. When the day of despair arrived,
the king could not resign himself to tears and servitude; within the
brazen-walled court he erected a funeral pyre, on which, together with
his chaste spouse and his bitterly lamenting daughters of beautiful
locks, he mounted; he raised his hands towards the depths of the ether
and cried: 'Proud fate, where is the gratitude of the gods, where is the
prince, the child of Leto? Where is now the house of Alyattes?... The
ancient citadel of Sardes has fallen, the Pactolus of golden waves
runs red with blood; ignominiously are the women driven from their
well-decked chambers! That which was once my hated foe is now my friend,
and the sweetest thing is to die!' Thus he spoke, and ordered the softly
moving eunuch* to set fire to the wooden structure.
</p>
<pre>
     * The word translated "softly moving eunuch" is here perhaps
     a proper name: the slave whose duty it was to kindle the
     pyre was called Abrobatas in the version of the story chosen
     by Bacchylides, while that adopted by the potter whose work
     is reproduced on the opposite page, calls him Euthymos.
</pre>
<p>
The maidens shrieked and threw their arms around their mother, for the
death before them was that most hated by mortals. But just when the
sparkling fury of the cruel fire had spread around, Zeus, calling up a
black-flanked cloud, extinguished the yellow flame.
</p>
<p>
Nothing is incredible of that which the will of the gods has decreed:
Apollo of Delos, seizing the old man, bore him, together with his
daughters of tender feet, into the Hyperborean land as a reward for
his piety, for no mortal had sent richer offerings to the illustrious
Pythô!"

This miraculous ending delighted the poets and inspired many fine
lines, but history could with difficulty accommodate itself to such a
materialistic intervention of a divine being, and sought a less
fabulous solution. The legend which appeared most probable to the worthy
Herodotus did not even admit that the Lydian king took his own life;
it was Cyrus who condemned him, either with a view of devoting the
first-fruits of his victory to the immortals, or to test whether the
immortals would save the rival whose piety had been so frequently held
up to his admiration. The edges of the pyre had already taken light,
when the Lydian king sighed and thrice repeated the name of Solon. It
was a tardy recollection of a conversation in which the Athenian sage
had stated, without being believed, that none can be accounted truly
happy while they still live. Cyrus, applying it to himself, was seized
with remorse or pity, and commanded the bystanders to quench the fire,
but their efforts were in vain. Thereupon Croesus implored the pity of
Apollo, and suddenly the sky, which up till then had been serene and
clear, became overcast; thick clouds collected, and rain fell so
heavily that the burning pile was at once extinguished.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The story told by Nicolas of Damascus comes down probably
     from Xanthus of Lydia, but with many additions borrowed
     directly from Herodotus and rhetorical developments by the
     author himself. Most other writers who tell the story depend
     for their information, either directly or indirectly, on
     Herodotus: in later times it was supposed that the Lydian
     king was preserved from the flames by the use of some
     talisman such as the Ephesian letters.
</pre>
<p>
Well treated by his conqueror, the Lydian king is said to have become
his friend and most loyal counsellor; he accepted from him the fief of
Barênê in Media, often accompanied him in his campaigns, and on more
than one occasion was of great service to him by the wise advice which
he gave.

We may well ask what would have taken place had he gained the decisive
victory over Cyrus that he hoped. Chaldæa possessed merely the semblance
of her former greatness and power, and if she still maintained her hold
over Mesopotamia, Syria, Phoenicia, and parts of Arabia, it was because
these provinces, impoverished by the Assyrian conquest, and entirely
laid waste by the Scythians, had lost the most energetic elements
of their populations, and felt themselves too much enfeebled to
rise against their suzerain. Egypt, like Chaldæa, was in a state of
decadence, and even though her Pharaohs attempted to compensate for the
inferiority of their native troops by employing foreign mercenaries,
their attempts at Asiatic rule always issued in defeat, and just as the
Babylonian sovereigns were unable to reduce them to servitude, so they
on their part were powerless to gain an advantage over the sovereigns of
Babylon. Hence Lydia, in her youth and vigour, would have found little
difficulty in gaining the ascendency over her two recent allies, but
beyond that she could not hope to push her success; her restricted
territory, sparse population, and outlying position would always have
debarred her from exercising any durable dominion over them, and though
absolute mistress of Asia Minor, the countries beyond the Taurus were
always destined to elude her grasp. If the Achæmenian, therefore, had
confined himself, at all events for the time being, to the ancient
limits of his kingdom, Egypt and Chaldæa would have continued to
vegetate each within their respective area, and the triumph of Croesus
would, on the whole, have caused but little change in the actual balance
of power in the East.
</p>
<p>
The downfall of Croesus, on the contrary, marked a decisive era in the
world's history. His army was the only one, from the point of numbers
and organisation, which was a match for that of Cyrus, and from the day
of its dispersion it was evident that neither Egypt nor Chaldæa had any
chance of victory on the battle-field. The subjection of Babylon and
Harrân, of Hamath, Damascus, Tyre and Sidon, of Memphis and Thebes, now
became merely a question of time, and that not far distant; the whole of
Asia, and that part of Africa which had been the oldest cradle of human
civilisation, were now to pass into the hands of one man and form a
single empire, for the benefit of the new race which was issuing forth
in irresistible strength from the recesses of the Iranian table-land. It
was destined, from the very outset, to come into conflict with an
older, but no less vigorous race than itself, that of the Greeks, whose
colonists, after having swarmed along the coasts of the Mediterranean,
were now beginning to quit the seaboard and penetrate wherever they
could into the interior.
</p>



<p>
They had been on friendly terms with that dynasty of the Meramadæ
who had shown reverence for the Hellenic gods; they had, as a whole,
disdained to betray Croesus, or to turn upon him when he was in
difficulties beyond the Halys; and now that he had succumbed to his
fate, they considered that the ties which had bound them to Sardes were
broken, and they were determined to preserve their independence at all
costs. This spirit of insubordination would have to be promptly dealt
with and tightly curbed, if perpetual troubles in the future were to
be avoided. The Asianic peoples soon rallied round their new
master&mdash;Phrygians, Mysians, the inhabitants on the shores of the Black
Sea, and those of the Pamphylian coast;* even Cilicia, which had held
its own against Chaldæa, Media, and Lydia, was now brought under the
rising power, and its kings were henceforward obedient to the Persian
rule.**
</p>
<pre>
     * None of the documents actually say this, but the general
     tenor of Herodotus' account seems to show clearly that, with
     the exception of the Greek cities of the Carians and
     Lycians, all the peoples who had formed part of the Lydian
     dominion under Croesus submitted, without any appreciable
     resistance, after the taking of Sardes.

     ** Herodotus mentions a second Syennesis king of Cilicia
     forty years later at the time of the Ionian revolt.
</pre>
<p>
The two leagues of the Ionians and Æolians had at first offered to
recognise Cyrus as their suzerain under the same conditions as those
with which Croesus had been satisfied; but he had consented to accept
it only in the case of Miletus, and had demanded from the rest an
unconditional surrender. This they had refused, and, uniting in a common
cause perhaps for the first time in their existence, they had resolved
to take up arms. As the Persians possessed no fleet, the Creeks had
nothing to fear from the side of the Ægean, and the severity of the
winter prevented any attack being made from the land side till the
following spring. They meanwhile sought the aid of their mother-country,
and despatched an embassy to the Spartans; the latter did not consider
it prudent to lend them troops, as they would have done in the case of
Croesus, but they authorised Lakrines, one of their principal citizens,
to demand of the great king that he should respect the Hellenic cities,
under pain of incurring their enmity.

Cyrus was fully occupied with the events then taking place in the
eastern regions of Iran; Babylon had not ventured upon any move after
having learned the news of the fall of Sardes, but the Bactrians and the
Sakæ had been in open revolt during the whole of the year that he had
been detained in the extreme west, and a still longer absence might risk
the loss of his prestige in Media, and even in Persia itself.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The tradition followed by Ctesias maintained that the
     submission of the eastern peoples was an accomplished fact
     when the Lydian war began. That adopted by Herodotus placed
     this event after the fall of Croesus; at any rate, it showed
     that fear of the Bactrians and the Sakæ, as well as of the
     Babylonians and Egyptians was the cause that hastened Cyrus'
     retreat.
</pre>
<p>
The threat of the Lacedaæmonians had little effect upon him; he
inquired as to what Sparta and Greece were, and having been informed,
he ironically begged the Lacedæmonian envoy to thank his compatriots for
the good advice with which they had honoured him; "but," he added, "take
care that I do not soon cause you to babble, not of the ills of the
Ionians, but of your own." He confided the government of Sardes to one
of his officers, named Tabalos, and having entrusted Paktyas, one of the
Lydians who had embraced his cause, with the removal of the treasures
of Croesus to Persia, he hastily set out for Ecbatana. He had scarcely
accomplished half of his journey when a revolt broke out in his rear;
Paktyas, instead of obeying his instructions, intrigued with the
Ionians, and, with the mercenaries he had hired from them, besieged
Tabalos in the citadel of Sardes. If the place capitulated, the entire
conquest would have to be repeated; fortunately it held out, and
its resistance gave Cyrus time to send its governor reinforcements,
commanded by Mazares the Median. As soon as they approached the city,
Paktyas, conscious that he had lost the day, took refuge at Kymê. Its
inhabitants, on being summoned to deliver him up, refused, but helped
him to escape to Mytilene, where the inhabitants of the island attempted
to sell him to the enemy for a large sum of money. The Kymæans saved him
a second time, and conveyed him to the temple of Athene Poliarchos
at Chios. The citizens, however, dragged him from his retreat, and
delivered him over to the Median general in exchange for Atarneus, a
district of Mysia, the possession of which they were disputing with the
Lesbians.* Paktyas being a prisoner, the Lydians were soon recalled
to order, and Mazares was able to devote his entire energies to the
reduction of the Greek cities; but he had accomplished merely the sack
of Priênê,** and the devastation of the suburbs of Magnesia on the
æander, when he died from some illness.
</p>
<pre>
     * A passage which has been preserved of Charon of Lampsacus
     sums up in a few words the account given by Herodotus of the
     adventures of Paktyas, but without mentioning the treachery
     of the islanders: he confines himself to saying Cyrus caught
     the fugitive after the latter had successively left Chios
     and Mytilene.

     ** Herodotus attributes the taking of this city to the
     Persian Tabules, who is evidently the Tabalos of Herodotus.

The Median Harpagus, to whom tradition assigns so curious a part as
regards Astyages and the infant Cyrus, succeeded him as governor of the
ancient Lydian kingdom, and completed the work which he had begun.
The first two places to be besieged were Phocæa and Teos, but their
inhabitants preferred exile to slavery; the Phocæans sailed away to
found Marseilles in the western regions of the Mediterranean, and
the people of Teos settled along the coast of Thracia, near to the
gold-mines of the Pangseus, and there built Abdera on the site of an
ancient Clazomenian colony. The other Greek towns were either taken by
assault or voluntarily opened their gates, so that ere long both Ionians
and Æolians were, with the exception of the Samians, under Persian rule.
The very position of the latter rendered them safe from attack; without
a fleet they could not be approached, and the only people who could have
furnished Cyrus with vessels were the Phoenicians, who were not as yet
under his power. The rebellion having been suppressed in this quarter,
Harpagus made a descent into Caria; the natives hastened to place
themselves under the Persian yoke, and the Dorian colonies scattered
along the coast, Halicarnas-sus, Cnidos, and the islands of Cos and
Rhodes, followed their examples, but Lycia refused to yield without a
struggle.
</p>


<p>
Its steep mountain chains, its sequestered valleys, its towns and
fortresses perched on inaccessible rocks, all rendered it easy for the
inhabitants to carry on a successful petty warfare against the enemy.
The inhabitants of Xanthos, although very inferior in numbers, issued
down into the plain and disputed the victory with the invaders for a
considerable time; at length their defeat and the capitulation of their
town induced the remainder of the Lycians to lay down arms, and brought
about the final pacification of the peninsula. It was parcelled out into
several governorships, according to its ethnographical affinities;
as for instance, the governorship of Lydia, that of Ionia, that of
Phrygia,* and others whose names are unknown to us. Harpàgus appeared
to have resided at Sardes, and exercised vice-regal functions over the
various districts, but he obtained from the king an extensive property
in Lycia and in Caria, which subsequently caused these two provinces to
be regarded as an appanage of his family.
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus calls a certain Mitrobates satrap of Daskylion;
     he had perhaps been already given this office by Cyrus.
     Orcetes had been made governor of Ionia and Lydia by Cyrus.
</pre>
<p>
While thus consolidating his first conquest, Cyrus penetrated into the
unknown regions of the far East. Nothing would have been easier for him
than to have fallen upon Babylon and overthrown, as it were by the way,
the decadent rule of Nabonidus; but the formidable aspect which the
empire still presented, in spite of its enfeebled condition, must have
deceived him, and he was unwilling to come into conflict with it until
he had made a final reckoning with the restless and unsettled peoples
between the Caspian and the slopes on the Indian side of the table-land
of Iran. As far as we are able to judge, they were for the most part of
Iranian extraction, and had the same religion, institutions, and customs
as the Medes and Persians. Tradition had already referred the origin of
Zoroaster, and the scene of his preaching, to Bactriana, that land of
heroes whose exploits formed the theme of Persian epic song. It is not
known, as we have already had occasion to remark, by what ties it was
bound to the empire of Cyaxares, nor indeed if it ever had been actually
attached to it. We do not possess, unfortunately, more than almost
worthless scraps of information on this part of the reign of Cyrus,
perhaps the most important period of it, since then, for the first
time, peoples who had been hitherto strangers to the Asiatic world were
brought within its influence. If Ctesias is to be credited, Bactriana
was one of the first districts to be conquered. Its inhabitants were
regarded as being among the bravest of the East, and furnished the best
soldiers. They at first obtained some successes, but laid down arms on
hearing that Cyrus had married a daughter of Astyages.* This tradition
was prevalent at a time when the Achaemenians were putting forward the
theory that they, and Cyrus before them, were the legitimate successors
of the old Median sovereigns; they welcomed every legend which tended to
justify their pretensions, and this particular one was certain to please
them, since it attributed the submission of Bactriana not to a mere
display of brute force, but to the recognition of an hereditary right.
The annexation of this province entailed, as a matter of course, that
of Margiana, of the Khoramnians,** and of Sogdiana. Cyrus constructed
fortresses in all these districts, the most celebrated being that
of Kyropolis, which commanded one of the principal fords of the
Iaxartes.***
</p>
<pre>
     * This is the campaign which Ctesias places before the
     Lydian war, but which Herodotus relegates to a date after
     the capture of Sardes.

     ** Ctesias must have spoken of the submission of these
     peoples, for a few words of a description which he gave of
     the Khoramnians have been preserved to us.

     *** Tomaschek identifies Kyra or Kyropolis with the present
     Ura-Tepe, but distinguishes it from the Kyreskhata of
     Ptolemy, to which he assigns a site near Usgent.

The steppes of Siberia arrested his course on the north, but to the
east, in the mountains of Chinese Turkestan, the Sakas, who were
renowned for their wealth and bravery, did not escape his ambitious
designs. The account which has come down to us of his campaigns against
them is a mere romance of love and adventure, in which real history
plays a very small part. He is said to have attacked and defeated
them at the first onset, taking their King Amorges prisoner; but this
capture, which Cyrus considered a decisive advantage, was supposed to
have turned the tide of fortune against him. Sparêthra, the wife of
Amorges, rallied the fugitives round her, defeated the invaders in
several engagements, and took so many of their men captive, that they
were glad to restore her husband to her in exchange for the prisoners
she had made. The struggle finally ended, however, in the subjection of
the Sakae; they engaged to pay tribute, and thenceforward constituted
the advance-guard of the Iranians against the Nomads of the East. Cyrus,
before quitting their neighbourhood, again ascended the table-land, and
reduced Ariana, Thatagus, Harauvati, Zaranka, and the country of Cabul;
and we may well ask if he found leisure to turn southwards beyond Lake
Hamun and reach the shores of the Indian Ocean. One tradition, of little
weight, relates that, like Alexander at a later date, he lost his army
in the arid deserts of Gedrosia; the one fact that remains is that the
conquest of Gedrosia was achieved, but the details of it are lost. The
period covered by his campaigns was from five to six years, from 545 to
539, but Cyrus returned from these expeditions into the unknown only to
plan fresh undertakings. There remained nothing now to hinder him from
marching against the Chaldæans, and the discord prevailing at Babylon
added to his chance of success. Nabonidus's passion for archæology
had in no way lessened since the opening of his reign. The temple
restorations prompted by it absorbed the bulk of his revenues. He made
excavations in the sub-structures of the most ancient sanctuaries,
such as Larsam, Uruk, Uru, Sippar, and Nipur; and when his digging was
rewarded by the discovery of cylinders placed there by his predecessors,
his delight knew no bounds. Such finds constituted the great events of
his life, in comparison with which the political revolutions of Asia
and Africa diminished in importance day by day. It is difficult to tell
whether this indifference to the weighty affairs of government was as
complete as it appears to us at this distance of time. Certain facts
recorded in the official chronicles of that date go to prove that,
except in name and external pomp, the king was a nonentity. The real
power lay in the hands of the nobles and generals, and Bel-sharuzur, the
king's son, directed affairs for them in his father's name. Nabonidus
meanwhile resided in a state of inactivity at his palace of Tima, and it
is possible that his condition may have really been that of a prisoner,
for he never left Tima to go to Babylon, even on the days of great
festivals, and his absence prevented the celebration of the higher
rites of the national religion, with the procession of Bel and its
accompanying ceremonies, for several consecutive years. The people
suffered from these quarrels in high places; not only the native
Babylonians or Kaldâ, who were thus deprived of their accustomed
spectacles, and whose piety was scandalised by these dissensions, but
also the foreign races dispersed over Mesopotamia, from the confluence
of the Khabur to the mouths of the Euphrates. Too widely scattered or
too weak to make an open declaration of their independence, their hopes
and their apprehensions were alternately raised by the various reports
of hostilities which reached their ears. The news of the first
victories of the Persians aroused in the exiled Jews the idea of speedy
deliverance, and Cyrus clearly appeared to them as the hero chosen by
Jahveh to reinstate them in the country, of their forefathers.

<p>
The number of the Jewish exiles, which perhaps at first had not exceeded
20,000* had largely increased in the half-century of their captivity,
and even if numerically they were of no great importance, their social
condition entitled them to be considered as the <i>élite</i> of all Israel.
</p>
<pre>
     * The body of exiles of 597 consisted of ten thousand
     persons, of whom seven thousand belonged to the wealthy, and
     one thousand to the artisan class, while the remainder
     consisted of people attached to the court (2 Kings xxiv. 14-
     16). In the body of 587 are reckoned three thousand and
     twenty-three inhabitants of Judah, and eight hundred and
     thirty-two dwellers in Jerusalem. But the body of exiles of
     581 numbers only seven hundred and forty-five persons (Jer.
     lii. 30). These numbers are sufficiently moderate to be
     possibly exact, but they are far from being certain.
</pre>
<p>
There had at first been the two kings, Jehoiachin and Zedekiah, their
families, the aristocracy of Judah, the priests and pontiff of the
temple, the prophets, the most skilled of the artisan class and the
soldiery. Though distributed over Babylon and the neighbouring cities,
we know from authentic sources of only one of their settlements, that
of Tell-Abîb on the Chebar* though many of the Jewish colonies which
flourished thereabouts in Roman times could undoubtedly trace their
origin to the days of the captivity; one legend found in the Talmud
affirmed that the synagogue of Shafyâthîb, near Nehardaa, had been built
by King Jehoiachin with stones brought from the ruins of the temple at
Jerusalem. These communities enjoyed a fairly complete autonomy, and
were free to administer their own affairs as they pleased, provided that
they paid their tribute or performed their appointed labours without
complaint. The shêkhs, or elders of the family or tribe, who had played
so important a part in their native land, still held their respective
positions; the Chaldæans had permitted them to retain all the
possessions which they had been able to bring with them into exile, and
recognised them as the rulers of their people, who were responsible to
their conquerors for the obedience of those under them, leaving them
entire liberty to exercise their authority so long as they maintained
order and tranquillity among their subordinates.**

How the latter existed, and what industries they pursued in order to
earn their daily bread, no writer of the time has left on record. The
rich plain of the Euphrates differed so widely from the soil to which
they had been accustomed in the land of Judah, with its bare or sparsely
wooded hills, slopes cultivated in terraces, narrow and ill-watered
wadys, and tortuous and parched valleys, that they must have felt
themselves much out of their element in their Chaldæan surroundings.
They had all of them, however, whether artisans, labourers, soldiers,
gold-workers, or merchants, to earn their living, and they succeeded in
doing so, following meanwhile the advice of Jeremiah, by taking every
precaution that the seed of Israel should not be diminished.* The
imagination of pious writers of a later date delighted to represent the
exiled Jews as giving way to apathy and vain regrets: "By the rivers of
Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. Upon
the willows in the midst thereof we hanged up our harps. For there
they that led us captive required of us songs, and they that wasted
us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How
shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?"**

     ** Ps. cxxxvii. 1-4.
</pre>
<p>
This was true of the priests and scribes only. A blank had been made in
their existence from the moment when the conqueror had dragged them
from the routine of daily rites which their duties in the temple service
entailed upon them. The hours which had been formerly devoted to their
offices were now expended in bewailing the misfortunes of their nation,
in accusing themselves and others, and in demanding what crime had
merited this punishment, and why Jahveh, who had so often shown clemency
to their forefathers, had not extended His forgiveness to them. It
was, however, by the long-suffering of God that His prophets, and
particularly Ezekiel, were allowed to make known to them the true cause
of their downfall. The more Ezekiel in his retreat meditated upon
their lot, the more did the past appear to him as a lamentable conflict
between divine justice and Jewish iniquity. At the time of their sojourn
in Egypt, Jahveh had taken the house of Jacob under His protection,
and in consideration of His help had merely demanded of them that they
should be faithful to Him. "Cast ye away every man the abominations of
his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the
Lord your God." The children of Israel, however, had never observed this
easy condition, and this was the root of their ills; even before
they were liberated from the yoke of Pharaoh, they had betrayed their
Protector, and He had thought to punish them: "But I wrought for My
name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations,
among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them....
So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them
into the wilderness. And I gave them My statutes, and showed them My
judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them. Moreover also I
gave them My sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them... but the house
of Israel rebelled against Me." As they had acted in Egypt, so they
acted at the foot of Sinai, and again Jahveh could not bring Himself to
destroy them; He confined Himself to decreeing that none of those who
had offended Him should enter the Promised Land, and He extended His
goodness to their children. But these again showed themselves no
wiser than their fathers; scarcely had they taken possession of the
inheritance which had fallen to them, "a land flowing with milk and
honey... the glory of all lands," than when they beheld "every high hill
and every thick tree... they offered there their sacrifices, and there
they presented the provocation of their offering, there also they made
their sweet savour, and they poured out there their drink offerings."
Not contented with profaning their altars by impious ceremonies and
offerings, they further bowed the knee to idols, thinking in their
hearts, "We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries,
to serve wood and stone." "As I live, saith the Lord God, surely with a
mighty hand and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will
I be King over you."*
</p>
<pre>
     1 Ezek. xx.
</pre>
<p>
However just the punishment, Bzekiel did not believe that it would last
for ever. The righteousness of God would not permit future generations
to be held responsible for ever for the sins of generations past and
present. "What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of
Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's
teeth are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have
occasion to use this proverb any more in Israel! Behold, all souls are
Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine;
the soul that sinneth it shall die. But if a man be just... he shall
surely live, saith the Lord God." Israel, therefore, was master of his
own destiny. If he persisted in erring from the right way, the hour
of salvation was still further removed from him; if he repented and
observed the law, the Divine anger would be turned away. "Therefore... O
house of Israel... cast away from you all your transgressions wherein
ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit; for why
will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death
of him that dieth... wherefore turn yourselves and live." 1 There were
those who objected that it was too late to dream of regeneration and of
hope in the future: "Our bones are dried up and our hope is lost; we are
clean cut off." The prophet replied that the Lord had carried him in the
spirit and set him down in the midst of a plain strewn with bones. "So
I prophesied... and as I prophesied there was a noise... and the bones
came together, bone to his bone. And I beheld, and lo, there were sinews
upon them, and flesh came up and skin covered them above; but there was
no breath in them. Then said (the Lord) unto me, Prophesy unto the wind,
prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God: Come
from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they
may live. So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into
them and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great
army. Then He said unto me... these bones are the whole house of
Israel.... Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up
out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of
Israel.... And I will put My Spirit in you and ye shall live, and I
will place you in your own land; and ye shall know that I the Lord hath
spoken it and performed it, saith the Lord."
</p>
<p>
A people raised from such depths would require a constitution, a new law
to take the place of the old, from the day when the exile should cease.
Ezekiel would willingly have dispensed with the monarchy, as it had been
tried since the time of Samuel with scarcely any good results. For every
Hezekiah or Josiah, how many kings of the type of Ahaz or Manasseh had
there been! The Jews were nevertheless still so sincerely attached to
the house of David, that the prophet judged it inopportune to exclude
it from his plan for their future government. He resolved to tolerate
a king, but a king of greater piety and with less liberty than the
compiler of the Book of Deuteronomy had pictured to himself, a servant
of the servants of God, whose principal function should be to provide
the means of worship. Indeed, the Lord Himself was the only Sovereign
whom the prophet fully accepted, though his concept of Him differed
greatly from that of his predecessors: from that, for instance, of
Amos&mdash;the Lord God who would do nothing without revealing "His secret
unto His servants the prophets;" or of Hosea&mdash;who desired "mercy, and
not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings."
The Jahveh of Ezekiel no longer admitted any intercourse with the
interpreters of His will. He held "the son of man" at a distance, and
would consent to communicate with him only by means of angels who were
His messengers. The love of His people was, indeed, acceptable to
Him, but He preferred their reverence and fear, and the smell of the
sacrifice offered according to the law was pleasing to His nostrils. The
first care of the returning exiles, therefore, would be to build Him
a house upon the holy mountain. Ezekiel called to mind the temple
of Solomon, in which the far-off years of his youth were spent, and
mentally rebuilt it on the same plan, but larger and more beautiful;
first the outer court, then the inner court and its chambers, and lastly
the sanctuary, the dimensions of which he calculates with scrupulous
care: "And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides
of the entrance were five cubits on the one side and five cubits on the
other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits; and
the breadth, twenty cubits"&mdash;and so forth, with a wealth of technical
details often difficult to be understood. And as a building so well
proportioned should be served by a priesthood worthy of it, the sons
of Zadok only were to bear the sacerdotal office, for they alone had
preserved their faith unshaken; the other Lévites were to fill merely
secondary posts, for not only had they shared in the sins of the nation,
but they had shown a bad example in practising idolatry. The duties and
prerogatives of each one, the tithes and offerings, the sacrifices, the
solemn festivals, the preparation of the feasts,&mdash;all was foreseen and
prearranged with scrupulous exactitude. Ezekiel was, as we have seen, a
priest; the smallest details were as dear to him as the noblest offices
of his calling, and the minute ceremonial instructions as to the killing
and cooking of the sacrificial animals appeared to him as necessary to
the future prosperity of his people as the moral law. Towards the end,
however, the imagination of the seer soared above the formalism of the
sacrificing priest; he saw in a vision waters issuing out of the very
threshold of the divine house, flowing towards the Dead Sea through a
forest of fruit trees, "whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall the
fruit thereof fail." The twelve tribes of Israel, alike those of whom
a remnant still existed as well as those which at different times
had become extinct, were to divide the regenerated land by lot among
them&mdash;Dan in the extreme north, Reuben and Judah in the south; and they
would unite to found once more, around Mount Sion, that new Jerusalem
whose name henceforth was to be Jahveh-shammah, "The Lord is there."*

The influence of Ezekiel does not seem to have extended beyond a
restricted circle of admirers. Untouched by his preaching, many of the
exiles still persisted in their worship of the heathen gods; most of
these probably became merged in the bulk of the Chaldæan population,
and were lost, as far as Israel was concerned, as completely as were
the earlier exiles of Ephraim under Tiglath-pileser III. and Sargon. The
greater number of the Jews, however, remained faithful to their hopes of
future greatness, and applied themselves to discerning in passing events
the premonitory signs of deliverance. "Like as a woman with child, that
draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her
pangs; so have we been before Thee, O Lord.... Come, my people, enter
thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for
a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the
Lord cometh forth out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the
earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and
shall no more cover her slain."* The condition of the people improved
after the death of Nebuchadrezzar. Amil-marduk took Jehoiachin out of
the prison in which he had languished for thirty years, and treated
him with honour:** this was not as yet the restoration that had been
promised, but it was the end of the persecution.

A period of court intrigues followed, during which the sceptre of
Nebuchadrezzar changed hands four times in less than seven years; then
came the accession of the peaceful and devout Nabonidus, the fall of
Astyages, and the first victories of Cyrus. Nothing escaped the vigilant
eye of the prophets, and they began to proclaim that the time was at
hand, then to predict the fall of Babylon, and to depict the barbarians
in revolt against her, and Israel released from the yoke by the
all-powerful will of the Persians. "Thus saith the Lord to His anointed,
to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden to subdue nations before him,
and I will loose the loins of kings; to open the doors before him, and
the gates shall not be shut; I will go before thee and make the rugged
places plain: I will break in pieces the doors of brass, rend in sunder
the bars of iron: and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and
hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I am the
Lord which call thee by thy name, even the God of Israel. For Jacob My
servant's sake, and Israel My chosen, I have called thee by thy name: I
have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known Me."* Nothing can stand
before the victorious prince whom Jahveh leads: "Bel boweth down, Nebo
stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the
things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary
beast. They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
burden, but themselves are gone into captivity."** "O virgin daughter
of Babylon, sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the
Chaldæans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. Take
the millstones and grind meal: remove thy veil, strip off the train,
uncover the leg, pass through the rivers. They nakedness shall be
uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen.... Sit thou silent, and get
thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldæans: for thou shalt no more
be called the lady of kingdoms."***

The task which Cyrus had undertaken was not so difficult as we might
imagine. Not only was he hailed with delight by the strangers who
thronged Babylonia, but the Babylonians themselves were weary of their
king, and the majority of them were ready to welcome the Persian who
would rid them of him, as in old days they hailed the Assyrian kings who
delivered them from their Chaldæan lords. It is possible that towards
the end of his reign Nabonidus partly resumed the supreme power;* but
anxious for the future, and depending but little on human help, he had
sought a more powerful aid at the hands of the gods. He had apparently
revived some of the old forgotten cults, and had applied to their use
revenues which impoverished the endowment of the prevalent worship of
his own time. As he felt the growing danger approach, he remembered
those towns of secondary grade&mdash;Uru, Uruk, Larsam, and Eridu&mdash;all
of which, lying outside Nebuchadrezzar's scheme of defence, would be
sacrificed in the case of an invasion: he had therefore brought away
from them the most venerated statues, those in which the spirit of the
divinity was more particularly pleased to dwell, and had shut them up in
the capital, within the security of its triple rampart.**
</p>
<pre>
     * This seems to follow from the part which he plays in the
     final crisis, as told in the <i>Cylinder of Cyrus</i> and in the
     <i>Annals</i>.

     ** The chronicler adds that the gods of Sippar, Kutha, and
     Borsippa were not taken to Babylon; and indeed, these cities
     being included within the lines of defence of the great
     city, their gods were as well defended from the enemy as if
     they had been in Babylon itself.
</pre>
<p>
This attempt to concentrate the divine powers, accentuating as it did
the supremacy of Bel-Marduk over his compeers, was doubtless flattering
to his pride and that of his priests, but was ill received by the rest
of the sacerdotal class and by the populace. All these divine guests had
not only to be lodged, but required to be watched over, decked, fed, and
feted, together with their respective temple retinues; and the prestige
and honour of the local Bel, as well as his revenues, were likely to
suffer in consequence. The clamour of the gods in the celestial heights
soon re-echoed throughout the land; the divinities complained of their
sojourn at Babylon as of a captivity in E-sagilla; they lamented over
the suppression of their daily sacrifices, and Marduk at length took
pity on them. He looked upon the countries of Sumir and Akkad, and saw
their sanctuaries in ruins and their towns lifeless as corpses; "he cast
his eyes over the surrounding regions; he searched them with his glance
and sought out a prince, upright, after his own heart, who should take
his hands. He proclaimed by name Cyrus, King of Anshân, and he called
him by his name to universal sovereignty." Alike for the people
of Babylon and for the exiled Jew, and also doubtless for other
stranger-colonies, Cyrus appeared as a deliverer chosen by the gods;
his speedy approach was everywhere expected, if not with the same
impatience, at least with an almost joyful resignation. His plans were
carried into action in the early months of 538, and his habitual good
fortune did not forsake him at this decisive moment of his career. The
immense citadel raised by Nebuchadrezzar in the midst of his empire, in
anticipation of an attack by the Medes, was as yet intact, and the walls
rising one behind another, the moats, and the canals and marshes which
protected it, had been so well kept up or restored since his time, that
their security was absolutely complete; a besieging army could do little
harm&mdash;it needed a whole nation in revolt to compass its downfall. A
whole nation also was required for its defence, but the Babylonians
were not inclined to second the efforts of their sovereign. Nabonidus
concentrated his troops at the point most threatened, in the angle
comprised near Opis between the Medic wall and the bend of the Tigris,
and waited in inaction the commencement of the attack. It is supposed
that Cyrus put two bodies of troops in motion: one leaving Susa under
his own command, took the usual route of all Blamite invasions in the
direction of the confluence of the Tigris and the Dîyala; the other
commanded by Gobryas, the satrap of Gutium, followed the course of
the Adhem or the Dîyala, and brought the northern contingents to the
rallying-place. From what we know of the facts as a whole, it would
appear that the besieging force chose the neighbourhood of the present
Bagdad to make a breach in the fortifications. Taking advantage of the
months when the rivers were at their lowest, they drew off the water
from the Dîyala and the Tigris till they so reduced the level that they
were able to cross on foot; they then cut their way through the ramparts
on the left bank, and rapidly transported the bulk of their forces
into the very centre of the enemy's position. The principal body of the
Chaldæan troops were still at Opis, cut off from the capital; Cyrus
fell upon them, overcame them on the banks of the Zalzallat in the early
days of Tammuz, urging forward Gobryas meanwhile upon Babylon itself.*
On the 14th of Tammuz, Nabonidus evacuated Sippar, which at once fell
into the hands of the Persian outposts; on the 16th Gobryas entered
Babylon without striking a blow, and Nabonidus surrendered himself a
prisoner.**

     * For the strategic interpretation of the events of this
     campaign I have generally adopted the explanations of
     Billerbeck. Herodotus' account with regard to the river
     Gyndes is probably a reminiscence of alterations made in the
     river-courses at the time of the attack in the direction of
     Bagdad.

     ** The <i>Cylinder of Cyrus</i>, 1. 17, expressly says so:
     "Without combat or battle did Marduk make him enter
     Babylon," The <i>Annals of Nabonidus</i> confirm this testimony
     of the official account.
</pre>
<p>
The victorious army had received orders to avoid all excesses which
would offend the people; they respected the property of the citizens and
of the temples, placed a strong detachment around Ê-sagilla to protect
it from plunder, and no armed soldier was allowed within the enclosure
until the king' had determined on the fate of the vanquished. Cyrus
arrived after a fortnight had elapsed, on the 3rd of March-esvân, and
his first act was one of clemency. He prohibited all pillage, granted
mercy to the inhabitants, and entrusted the government of the city to
Gobryas. Bel-sharuzur, the son of Nabonidus, remained to be dealt
with, and his energetic nature might have been the cause of serious
difficulties had he been allowed an opportunity of rallying the last
partisans of the dynasty around him. Gobryas set out to attack him, and
on the 11th of March-esvân succeeded in surprising and slaying him. With
him perished the last hope of the Chaldæans, and the nobles and towns,
still hesitating on what course to pursue, now vied with each other in
their haste to tender submission. The means of securing their good
will, at all events for the moment, was clearly at hand, and it was used
without any delay: their gods were at once restored to them. This exodus
extended over nearly two months, during March-esvân and Adar, and on
its termination a proclamation of six days of mourning, up to the 3rd of
Nisân, was made for the death of Bel-sharuzur, and as an atonement for
the faults of Nabonidus, after which, on the 4th of Nisân, the notables
of the city were called together in the temple of Nebo to join in the
last expiatory ceremonies. Cyrus did not hesitate for a moment to act
as Tiglath-pileser III. and most of the Sargonids had done; he "took the
hands of Bel," and proclaimed himself king of the country, but in order
to secure the succession, he associated his son Cambyses with himself
as King of Babylon. Mesopotamia having been restored to order, the
provinces in their turn transferred their allegiance to Persia; "the
kings enthroned in their palaces, from the Upper Sea to the Lower, those
of Syria and those who dwell in tents, brought their weighty tribute to
Babylon and kissed the feet of the suzerain." Events had followed one
another so quickly, and had entailed so little bloodshed, that popular
imagination was quite disconcerted: it could not conceive that an
empire of such an extent and of so formidable an appearance should have
succumbed almost without a battle, and three generations had not elapsed
before an entire cycle of legends had gathered round the catastrophe.
They related how Cyrus, having set out to make war, with provisions of
all kinds for his household, and especially with his usual stores of
water from the river Choaspes, the only kind of which he deigned to
drink, had reached the banks of the Gyndes. While seeking for a ford,
one of the white horses consecrated to the sun sprang into the river,
and being overturned by the current, was drowned before it could
be rescued. Cyrus regarded this accident as a personal affront, and
interrupted his expedition to avenge it. He employed his army during one
entire summer in digging three hundred and sixty canals, and thus caused
the principal arm of the stream to run dry, and he did not resume his
march upon Babylon till the following spring, when the level of the
water was low enough to permit of a woman crossing from one bank to the
other without wetting her knees. The Babylonians at first attempted
to prevent the blockade of the place, but being repulsed in their
<i>sorties</i>, they retired within the walls, much to Cyrus's annoyance, for
they were provisioned for several years. He therefore undertook to
turn the course of the Euphrates into the Bahr-î-Nejîf, and having
accomplished it, he crept into the centre of the city by the dry bed of
the river. If the Babylonians had kept proper guard, the Persians would
probably have been surrounded and caught like fish in a net; but on that
particular day they were keeping one of their festivals, and continued
their dancing and singing till they suddenly found the streets alive
with the enemy.
</p>
<p>
Babylon suffered in no way by her servitude, and far from its being a
source of unhappiness to her, she actually rejoiced in it; she was rid
of Nabonidus, whose sacrilegious innovations had scandalised her piety,
and she possessed in Cyrus a legitimate sovereign since he had "taken
the hands of Bel." It pleased her to believe that she had conquered her
victor rather than been conquered by him, and she accommodated herself
to her Persian dynasty after the same fashion that she had in turn
accustomed herself to Cossæan or Elamite, Ninevite or Chaldæan dynasties
in days gone by. Nothing in or around the city was changed, and she
remained what she had been since the fall of Assyria, the real capital
of the regions situated between the Mediterranean and the Zagros. It
seems that none of her subjects&mdash;whether Syrians, Tyrians, Arabs, or
Idumæans&mdash;attempted to revolt against their new master, but passively
accepted him, and the Persian dominion extended uncontested as far as
the isthmus of Suez; Cyprus even, and such of the Phoenicians as
were still dependencies of Egypt, did homage to her without further
hesitation. The Jews alone appeared only half satisfied, for the
clemency shown by Cyrus to their oppressors disappointed their hopes
and the predictions of their prophets. They had sung in anticipation of
children killed before their fathers' eyes, of houses pillaged, of
women violated, and Babylon, the glory of the empire and the beauty
of Chaldæan pride, utterly destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrha when
overthrown by Jahveh. "It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be
dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch
tent there; neither shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there.
But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be
full of doleful creatures; and ostriches shall dwell there, and satyrs
shall dance there. And wolves shall cry in their castles, and jackals in
the pleasant palaces."*

Cyrus, however, was seated on the throne, and the city of
Nebuchadrezzar, unlike that of Sargon and Sennacherib, still continued
to play her part in the world's history. The revenge of Jerusalem had
not been as complete as that of Samaria, and her sons had to content
themselves with obtaining the cessation of their exile. It is impossible
to say whether they had contributed to the downfall of Nabonidus
otherwise than by the fervency of their prayers, or if they had rendered
Cyrus some service either in the course of his preparations or during
his short campaign. They may have contemplated taking up arms in his
cause, and have been unable to carry the project into execution owing
to the rapidity with which events took place. However this may be, he
desired to reward them for their good intentions, and in the same year
as his victory, he promulgated a solemn edict, in which he granted them
permission to return to Judah and to rebuild not only their city, but
the temple of their God. The inhabitants of the places where they were
living were charged to furnish them with silver, gold, materials, and
cattle, which would be needed by those among them who should claim the
benefits of the edict; they even had restored to them, by order of the
king, what remained in the Babylonian treasury of the vessels of gold
and silver which had belonged to the sanctuary of Jahveh. The heads
of the community received the favour granted to them from such high
quarters, without any enthusiasm. Now that they were free to go, they
discovered that they were well off at Babylon. They would have to
give up their houses, their fields, their business, their habits of
indifference to politics, and brave the dangers of a caravan journey of
three or four months' duration, finally encamping in the midst of
ruins in an impoverished country, surrounded by hostile and jealous
neighbours; such a prospect was not likely to find favour with many, and
indeed it was only the priests, the Lévites, and the more ardent of
the lower classes who welcomed the idea of the return with a touching
fervour. The first detachment organised their departure in 536,
under the auspices of one of the princes of the royal house, named
Shauash-baluzur (Sheshbazzar), a son of Jehoiachin.* It comprised only a
small number of families, and contained doubtless a few of the captives
of Nebuchadrezzar who in their childhood had seen the temple standing
and had been present at its destruction.
</p>
<pre>
     * The name which is written Sheshbazzar in the Hebrew text
     of the Book of Ezra (i. 9, 11; v. 14, 16) is rendered
     Sasabalassaros in Lucian's recension of the Septuagint, and
     this latter form confirms the hypothesis of Hoonacker, which
     is now universally accepted, that it corresponds to the
     Babylonian Shamash-abaluzur. It is known that Shamash
     becomes Shauash in Babylonian; thus Saosdukhînos comes from
     Shamash-shumukîn: similarly Shamash-abaluzur has become
     Shauash-abaluzur. Imbert has recognised Sheshbazzar,
     Shauash-abaluzur in the Shenazzar mentioned in 1 Chron. iii.
     8, as being one of the sons of Jeconiah, and this
     identification has been accepted by several recent
     historians of Israel. It should be remembered that Shauash-
     abaluzur and Zerubbabel have long been confounded one with
     the other.

The returning exiles at first settled in the small towns of Judah and
Benjamin, and it was not until seven months after their arrival that
they summoned courage to clear the sacred area in order to erect in its
midst an altar of sacrifice.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The history of this first return from captivity is
     summarily set forth in Ezra i.; cf. v. 13-17; vi. 3-5, 15.
     Its authenticity has been denied: with regard to this point
     and the questions relating to Jewish history after the
     exile, the modifications which have been imposed on the
     original plan of this work have obliged me to suppress much
     detail in the text and the whole of the bibliography in the
     notes.

They formed there, in the land of their fathers, a little colony, almost
lost among the heathen nations of former times&mdash;Philistines, Idumasans,
Moabites, Ammonites, and the settlers implanted at various times in what
had been the kingdom of Israel by the sovereigns of Assyria and Chaldæa.
Grouped around the Persian governor, who alone was able to protect them
from the hatred of their rivals, they had no hope of prospering, or even
of maintaining their position, except by exhibiting an unshaken fidelity
to their deliverers. It was on this very feeling that Cyrus mainly
relied when he granted them permission to return to their native
hills, and he was actuated as much by a far-seeing policy as from the
promptings of instinctive generosity. It was with satisfaction that he
saw in that distant province, lying on the frontier of the only enemy
yet left to him in the old world, a small band, devoted perforce to his
interests, and whose very existence depended entirely on that of his
empire. He no doubt extended the same favour to the other exiles in
Chaldæa who demanded it of him, but we do not know how many of them
took advantage of the occasion to return to their native countries, and
this exodus of the Jews still remains, so far as we know, a unique
fact. The administration continued the same as it had been under the
Chaldæans; Aramæan was still the official language in the provincial
dependencies, and the only change effected was the placing of Persians
at the head of public offices, as in Asia Minor, and allowing them a
body of troops to support their authority.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The presence of Persian troops in Asia Minor is proved by
     the passage in Herodotus where he says that Orotes had with
     him 1000 Persians as his body-guard.
</pre>
<p>
One great state alone remained of all those who had played a prominent
part in the history of the East. This was Egypt; and the policy which
her rulers had pursued since the development of the Iranian power
apparently rendered a struggle with it inevitable. Amasis had taken part
in all the coalitions which had as their object the perpetuation of
the balance of the powers in Western Asia; he had made a treaty with
Croesus, and it is possible that his contingents had fought in the
battles before Sardes; Lydia having fallen, he did all in his power to
encourage Nabonidus in his resistance. As soon as he found himself face
to face with Cyrus, he understood that a collision was imminent, and
did his best in preparing to meet it. Even if Cyrus had forgotten the
support which had been freely given to his rivals, the wealth of Egypt
was in itself sufficient to attract the Persian hordes to her frontiers.
</p>
<p>
A century later, the Egyptians, looking back on the past with a
melancholy retrospection, confessed that "never had the valley been
more flourishing or happier than under Amasis; never had the river
shown itself more beneficent to the soil, nor the soil more fertile
for mankind, and the inhabitated towns might be reckoned at 20,000 in
number." The widespread activity exhibited under Psammetichus II., and
Apries, was redoubled under the usurper, and the quarries of Turah,*
Silsileh,** Assuan, and even those of Hammamât, were worked as in the
palmy days of the Theban dynasties. The island of Philæ, whose position
just below the cataract attracted to it the attention of the military
engineers, was carefully fortified and a temple built upon it, the
materials of which were used later on in the masonry of the sanctuary of
Ptolemaic times. Thebes exhibited a certain outburst of vitality under
the impulse given by Ankhnasnofiribri and by Shashonqu, the governor of
her palace;*** two small chapels, built in the centre of the town, still
witness to the queen's devotion to Amon, of whom she was the priestess.
Wealthy private individuals did their best to emulate their sovereign's
example, and made for themselves at Shêkh Abd-el-Gurnah and at Assassif
those rock-hewn tombs which rival those of the best periods in their
extent and the beauty of their bas-reliefs.****
</p>
<pre>
     * A stele of his forty-fourth year still exists in the
     quarries of the Mokattam.

     ** According to Herodotus, it was from the quarries of
     Elephantine that Amasis caused to be brought the largest
     blocks which he used in the building of Sais.

     *** Her tomb still exists at Deir el-Medineh, and the
     sarcophagus, taken from the tomb in 1833, is now in the
     British Museum.

     the father of Shashonqu, who was associated with
     Ankhnasnofiribri in the government of Thebes.

Most of the cities of the Said were in such a state of decadence that it
was no longer possible to restore to them their former prosperity, but
Abydos occupied too important a place in the beliefs connected with the
future world, and attracted too many pilgrims, to permit of its being
neglected. The whole of its ancient necropolis had been rifled by
thieves during the preceding centuries, and the monuments were nearly as
much buried by sand as in our own times.

The dismantled fortress now known as the Shunêt ez-Zebîb served as the
cemetery for the ibises of Thoth, and for the stillborn children of the
sacred singing-women, while the two Memnonia of Seti and Ramses, now
abandoned by their priests, had become mere objects of respectful
curiosity, on which devout Egyptians or passing travellers&mdash;Phoenicians,
Aramæans, Cypriots, Carians, and Greeks from Ionia and the isles&mdash;came
to carve their names.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The position occupied by the graffiti on certain portions
     of the walls show that in these places in the temple of Seti
     there was already a layer of sand varying from one to three

</pre>
<p>
Amasis confided the work of general restoration to one of the principal
personages of his court, Pefzââunît, Prince of Sais, who devoted his
attention chiefly to two buildings&mdash;the great sanctuary of Osiris, which
was put into good condition throughout, and the very ancient necropolis
of Omm-el-Graab, where lay hidden the <i>àlquhah</i>, one of the sepulchres
of the god; he restored the naos, the table of offerings, the barques,
and the temple furniture, and provided for the sacred patrimony by an
endowment of fields, vineyards, palm groves, and revenues, so as to
ensure to the sanctuary offerings in perpetuity. It was a complete
architectural resurrection. The nomes of Middle Egypt, which had
suffered considerably during the Ethiopian and Assyrian wars, had
some chance of prosperity now that their lords were relieved from the
necessity of constantly fighting for some fresh pretender. Horu, son
of Psam-metichus, Prince of the Oleander nome, rebuilt the ancient
sanctuary of Harshafaîtu at Heracleopolis, and endowed it with a
munificence which rivalled that of Pefzââunîfc at Abydos. The king
himself devoted his resources chiefly to works at Memphis and in the
Delta. He founded a temple of Isis at Memphis, which Herodotus
described as extending over an immense area and being well worth seeing;
unfortunately nothing now remains of it, nor of the recumbent colossus,
sixty feet in length, which the king placed before the court of Phtah,
nor of the two gigantic statues which he raised in front of the temple,
one on each side of the door.

</center>

<p>
Besides these architectural works, Amasis invested the funerary
ceremonies of the Apis-bulls with a magnificence rarely seen before
his time, and the official stelae which he carved to the memory of
the animals who died in his reign exhibit a perfection of style quite
unusual. His labours at Memphis, however, were eclipsed by the admirable
work which he accomplished at Sais. The propylæ which he added to the
temple of Nît "surpassed most other buildings of the same kind, as
much by their height and extent, as by the size and quality of the
materials;" he had, moreover, embellished them by a fine colonnade, and
made an approach to them by an avenue of sphinxes.

<p>
In other parts of the same building were to be seen two superb obelisks,
a recumbent figure similar to that at Memphis, and a monolithic naos
of rose granite brought from the quarries of Elephantine. Amasis had a
special predilection for this kind of monument. That which he erected at
Thmuis is nearly twenty-three feet in height,* and the Louvre contains
another example, which though smaller still excites the admiration of
the modern visitor.**

The naos of Sais, which amazed Herodotus, was much larger than either of
the two already mentioned, or, indeed, than any known example. Tradition
states that it took two thousand boatmen three years to convey it down
from the first cataract. It measured nearly thirty feet high in the
interior, twenty-four feet in depth, and twelve feet in breadth; even
when hollowed out to contain the emblem of the god, it still weighed
nearly 500,000 kilograms. It never reached its appointed place in the
sanctuary. The story goes that "the architect, at the moment when the
monument had been moved as far as a certain spot in the temple, heaved
a sigh, oppressed with the thought of the time expended on its transport
and weary of the arduous work. Amasis overheard the sigh, and taking it
as an omen, he commanded that the block should be dragged no further.
Others relate that one of the overseers in charge of the work was
crushed to death by the monument, and for this reason it was left
standing on the spot," where for centuries succeeding generations came
to contemplate it.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The measurements given by Herodotus are so different from
     those of any naos as yet discovered, that I follow Kenrick
     in thinking that Herodotus saw the monument of Amasis lying
     on its side, and that he took for the height what was really
     the width in depth. It had been erected in the nome of
     Athribis, and afterwards taken to Alexandria about the
     Ptolemaic era; it was discovered under water in one of the
     ports of the town at the beginning of this century, and
     Drovetti, who recovered it, gave it to the Museum of the
     Louvre in 1825.
</pre>
<p>
Amasis, in devoting his revenues to such magnificent works, fully shared
the spirit of the older Pharaohs, and his labours were nattering to
the national vanity, even though many lives were sacrificed in their
accomplishment; but the glory which they reflected on Egypt did not
have the effect of removing the unpopularity in which Tie was personally
held. The revolution which overthrew Apries had been provoked by the
hatred of the native party towards the foreigners; he himself had been
the instrument by which it had been accomplished, and it would have been
only natural that, having achieved a triumph in spite of the Greeks and
the mercenaries, he should have wished to be revenged on them, and have
expelled them from his dominions. But, as a fact, nothing of the kind
took place, and Amasis, once crowned, forgot the wrongs he had suffered
as an aspirant to the royal dignity; no sooner was he firmly seated on
the throne, than he recalled the strangers, and showed that he had only
friendly intentions with regard to them. His predecessors had received
them into favour, he, in fact, showed a perfect infatuation for them,
and became as complete a Greek as it was possible for an Egyptian to be.
His first care had been to make a treaty with the Dorians of Oyrene, and
he displayed so much tact in dealing with them, that they forgave him
for the skirmish of Irasa, and invited him to act as arbitrator in their
dissensions. A certain Arkesilas II. had recently succeeded the Battos
who had defeated the Egyptian troops, but his suspicious temper had
obliged his brothers to separate themselves from him, and they had
founded further westwards the independent city of Barca. On his
threatening to evict them, they sent a body of Libyans against him.
Fighting ensued, and he was beaten close to the town of Leukon. He
lost 7000 hoplites in the engagement, and the disaster aroused so
much ill-feeling against him that Laarchos, another of his brothers,
strangled him. Laarchos succeeded him amid the acclamations of the
soldiery; but not long after, Eryxô and Polyarchos, the wife and
brother-in-law of his victim, surprised and assassinated him in his
turn. The partisans of Laarchos then had recourse to the Pharaoh, who
showed himself disposed to send them help; but his preparations were
suspended owing to the death of his mother. Polyarchos repaired to Egypt
before the royal mourning was ended, and pleaded his cause with such
urgency that he won over the king to his side; he obtained the royal
investiture for his sister's child, who was still a minor, Battos III.,
the lame, and thus placed Oyrene in a sort of vassalage to the Egyptian
crown.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus narrates these events without mentioning Amasis,
     and Nicolas of Damascus adopted Herodotus' account with
     certain modifications taken from other sources. The
     intervention of Amasis is mentioned only by Plutarch and by
     Polyaanus; but the record of it had been handed down to them
     by some more ancient author&mdash;perhaps by Akesandros; or
     perhaps, in the first instance, by Hellanicos of Lesbos, who
     gave a somewhat detailed account of certain points in
     Egyptian history. The passage of Herodotus is also found
     incorporated in accounts of Cyrenian origin: his informants
     were interested in recalling deeds which reflected glory on
     their country, like the defeat of Apries at Irasa, but not
     in the memory of events so humiliating for them as the
     sovereign intervention of Pharaoh only a few years after
     this victory. And besides, the merely pacific success which
     Amasis achieved was not of a nature to leave a profound mark
     on the Egyptian mind. It is thus easy to explain how it was
     that Herodotus makes no allusion to the part played by Egypt
     in this affair.
</pre>
<p>
The ties which connected the two courts were subsequently drawn closer
by marriage; partly from policy and partly from a whim, Amasis espoused
a Cyrenian woman named Ladikê, the daughter, according to some, of
Arkesilas or of Battos, according to others, of a wealthy private
individual named Kritobulos.* The Greeks of Europe and Asia Minor fared
no less to their own satisfaction at his hand than their compatriots
in Africa; following the example of his ally Croesus, he entered
into relations with their oracles on several occasions, and sent them
magnificent presents. The temple of Delphi having been burnt down in
548, the Athenian family of the Alcmæonides undertook to rebuild it from
the ground for the sum of three hundred talents, of which one-fourth was
to be furnished by the Delphians. When these, being too poor to pay
the sum out of their own resources, made an appeal to the generosity of
other friendly powers, Amasis graciously offered them a thousand talents
of Egyptian alum, then esteemed the most precious of all others. Alum
was employed in dyeing, and was an expensive commodity in the markets of
Europe; the citizens of Delphi were all the more sensible of Pharaoh's
generosity, since the united Greeks of the Nile valley contributed only
twenty <i>minæ</i> of the same mineral as their quota. Amasis erected at
Cyrene a statue of his wife Ladikê, and another of the goddess Neît,
gilded from head to foot, and to these he added his own portrait,
probably painted on a wooden panel.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The very fact of the marriage is considered by Wiedemann
     as a pure legend, but there is nothing against its
     authenticity; the curious story of the relations of the
     woman with Amasis told by the Cyrenian commentators is the
     only part which need be rejected.

     ** The text of Herodotus can only mean a painted panel
     similar to those which have been found on the mummies of the
     Græco-Roman era in the Fayum.
</pre>
<p>
He gave to Athene of Lindos two stone statues and a corselet of linen
of marvellous fineness;* and Hera of Samos received two wooden statues,
which a century later Herodotus found still intact. The Greeks flocked
to Egypt from all quarters of the world in such considerable numbers
that the laws relating to them had to be remodelled in order to avoid
conflicts with the natives.
</p>
<pre>
     * It seems that one of these statues is that which, after
     being taken to Constantinople, was destroyed in a fire in
     476 A.D. Fragments of the corselet still existed in the
     first century of our era, but inquisitive persons used to
     tear off pieces to see for themselves whether, as Herodotus
     assures us, each thread was composed of three hundred and
     sixty-five strands, every one visible with the naked eye.
</pre>
<p>
The townships founded a century earlier along the Pelusiac arm of the
Nile had increased still further since the time of Necho, and to their
activity was attributable the remarkable prosperity of the surrounding
region. But the position which they occupied on the most exposed side
of Egypt was regarded as permanently endangering the security of the
country: her liberty would be imperilled should they revolt during a war
with the neighbouring empire, and hand over the line of defence which
was garrisoned by them to the invader. Amasis therefore dispossessed
their inhabitants, and transferred them to Memphis and its environs.
The change benefited him in two ways, for, while securing himself from
possible treason, he gained a faithful guard for himself in the event of
risings taking place in his turbulent capital. While he thus distributed
these colonists of ancient standing to his best interests, he placed
those of quite recent date in the part of the Delta furthest removed
from Asia, where surveillance was most easy, in the triangle, namely,
lying to the west of Sais, between the Canopic branch of the Nile, the
mountains, and the sea-coast. The Milesians had established here some
time previously, on a canal connected with the main arm of the river,
the factory of Naucratis, which long remained in obscurity, but suddenly
developed at the beginning of the XXVIth dynasty, when Sais became the
favourite residence of the Pharaohs. This town Amasis made over to the
Greeks so that they might make it the commercial and religious centre of
their communities in Egypt.

<p>
Temples already existed there, those of Apollo and Aphrodite, together
with all the political and religious institutions indispensable to the
constitution of an Hellenic city; but the influx of immigrants was
so large and rapid, that, after the lapse of a few years, the entire
internal organism and external aspect of the city were metamorphosed.
New buildings rose from the ground with incredible speed&mdash;the little
temple of the Dioskuri, the protectors of the sailor, the temple of the
Samian Hera, that of Zeus of Ægina, and that of Athene;* ere long the
great temenos, the Hellenion, was erected at the public expense by nine
Æolian, Ionian, and Dorian towns of Asia Minor, to serve as a place of
assembly for their countrymen, as a storehouse, as a sanctuary, and,
if need be, even as a refuge and fortress, so great was its area and so
thick its walls.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The temple of Athene, the Nît of the Saite nome, is as yet
     known only by an inscription in Pctrie.

     ** The site has been rediscovered by Petrie at the southern
     extremity of and almost outside the town; the walls were
     about 48 feet thick and 39 feet high, and the rectangular
     area enclosed by them could easily contain fifty thousand
     men.

<p>
It was not possible for the constitution of Naucratis to be very
homogeneous, when a score of different elements assisted in its
composition. It appears to have been a compromise between the
institutions of the Dorians and those of the Ionians. Its supreme
magistrates were called timuchi, but their length of office and
functions are alike unknown to us. The inspectors of the emporia and
markets could be elected only by the citizens of the nine towns, and it
is certain that the chief authority was not entirely in the hands either
of the timuchi or the inspectors; perhaps each quarter of the town had
its council taken from among the oldest residents. A prytanasum was open
to all comers where assemblies and banquets were held on feast-days;
here were celebrated at the public expense the festivals of Dionysos
and Apollo Komasos. Amasis made the city a free port, accessible at all
times to whoever should present themselves with peaceable intent, and
the privileges which he granted naturally brought about the closing of
all the other seaports of Egypt. When a Greek ship, pursued by pirates,
buffeted by storms, or disabled by an accident at sea, ran ashore at
some prohibited spot on the coast, the captain had to appear before the
nearest magistrate, in order to swear that he had not violated the law
wilfully, but from the force of circumstances. If his excuse appeared
reasonable, he was permitted to make his way to the mouth of the Canopic
branch of the Nile; but when the state of the wind or tide did not allow
of his departure, his cargo was transferred to boats of the locality,
and sent to the Hellenic settlement by the canals of the Delta. This
provision of the law brought prosperity to Naucratis; the whole of the
commerce of Egypt with the Greek world passed through her docks, and
in a few years she became one of the wealthiest emporia of the
Mediterranean. The inhabitants soon overflowed the surrounding country,
and covered it with villas and townships. Such merchants as refused to
submit to the rule of their own countrymen found a home in some other
part of the valley which suited them, and even Upper Egypt and the
Libyan desert were subject to their pacific inroads. The Milesians
established depots in the ancient city of Abydos;* the Cypriots and
Lesbians, and the people of Ephesus, Chios, and Samos, were scattered
over the islands formed by the network of canals and arms of the Nile,
and delighted in giving them the names of their respective countries;**
Greeks of diverse origin settled themselves at Neapolis, not far from
Panopolis; and the Samians belonging to the Æschrionian tribe penetrated
as far as the Great Oasis; in fact, there was scarcely a village where
Hellenic traders were not found, like the <i>bakals</i> of to-day, selling
wine, perfumes, oil, and salted provisions to the natives, practising
usury in all its forms, and averse from no means of enriching themselves
as rapidly as possible.
</p>
<pre>
     * In Stephen of Byzantium the name of the town is said to be
     derived from that of the Milesian Abydos who founded it,
     probably on the testimony of Aristagoras. Letronne has seen
     that the historian meant a factory established by the
     Milesians probably in the reign of Amasis, at the terminus
     of the route leading to the Great Oasis.

     ** The compiler confines himself to stating that there were
     in the Nile islands called Ephesus, Chios, Samos, Lesbos,
     Cyprus, and so on; the explanation I have given in the text
     accounts for this curious fact quite simply.
</pre>
<p>
Those who returned to their mother-country carried thither
strange tales, which aroused the curiosity and cupidity of their
fellow-citizens; and philosophers, merchants, and soldiers alike set out
for the land of wonders in pursuit of knowledge, wealth, or adventures.
Amasis, ever alert upon his Asiatic frontier, and always anxious
to strengthen himself in that quarter against a Chaldæan or Persian
invasion, welcomed them with open arms: those who remained in the
country obtained employment about his person, while such as left it not
to return, carried away with them the memory of his kindly treatment,
and secured for him in Hellas alliances of which he might one day
stand in need. The conduct of Amasis was politic, but it aroused the
ill-feeling of his subjects against him. Like the Jews under Hezekiah,
the Babylonians under Nabonidus, and all other decadent races threatened
by ruin, they attributed their decline, not to their own vices, but to
the machinations of an angry god, and they looked on favours granted to
strangers as a sacrilege. Had not the Greeks brought their divinities
with them? Did they not pervert the simple country-folk, so that they
associated the Greek religion with that of their own country? Money
was scarce; Amasis had been obliged to debit the rations and pay of
his mercenaries to the accounts of the most venerated Egyptian
temples&mdash;those of Sais, Heliopolis, Bubastis, and Memphis; and each
of these institutions had to rebate so much per cent. on their annual
revenues in favour of the barbarians, and hand over to them considerable
quantities of corn, cattle, poultry, stuffs, woods, perfumes, and
objects of all kinds. The priests were loud in their indignation, the
echo of which still rang in the ears of the faithful some centuries
later, and the lower classes making common cause with their priests, a
spirit of hatred was roused among the populace as bitter as that which
had previously caused the downfall of Apries. As the fear of the army
prevented this feeling from manifesting itself in a revolt, it found
expression in the secret calumnies which were circulated against the
king, and misrepresented the motives of all his actions. Scores of
malicious stories were repeated vilifying his character. It was stated
that before his accession he was much addicted to eating and drinking,
but that, suffering from want of money, he had not hesitated in
procuring what he wished for by all sorts of means, the most honest of
which had been secret theft. When made king, he had several times given
way to intoxication to such an extent as to be incapable of attending to
public business; his ministers were then obliged to relate moral tales
to him to bring him to a state of reason. Many persons having taunted
him with his low extraction, he had caused a statue of a divinity to be
made out of a gold basin in which he was accustomed to wash his feet,
and he had exposed it to the adoration of the faithful. When it had been
worshipped by them for some time, he revealed the origin of the idol,
and added "that it had been with himself as with the foot-pan.... If he
were a private person formerly, yet now he had come to be their king,
and so he bade them honour and reverence him." Towards the middle and
end of his reign he was as much detested as he had been beloved at the
outset.
</p>
<p>
He had, notwithstanding, so effectively armed Egypt that the Persians
had not ventured to risk a collision with her immediately after their
conquest of Babylon. Cyrus had spent ten years in compassing the
downfall of Nabonidus, and, calculating that that of Amasis would
require no less a period of time, he set methodically to work on the
organisation of his recently acquired territory; the cities of Phoenicia
acknowledged him as their suzerain, and furnished him with what had
hitherto been a coveted acquisition, a fleet. These preliminaries
had apparently been already accomplished, when the movements of the
barbarians suddenly made his presence in the far East imperative. He
hurried thither, and was mysteriously lost to sight (529). Tradition
accounts for his death in several ways. If Xenophon is to be credited,
he died peaceably on his bed, surrounded by his children, and edifying
those present by his wisdom and his almost superhuman resignation.*
</p>
<pre>
     * A similar legend, but later in date, told how Cyrus, when
     a hundred years old, asked one day to see his friends. He
     was told that his son had had them all put to death: his
     grief at the cruelty of Cambyses caused his death in a few
     days.

Berosus tells us that he was killed in a campaign against the Daliæ;
Ctesias states that, living been wounded in a skirmish with the
Æerbikes, one of the savage tribes of Bactriana, he succumbed to his
injuries three days after the engagement. According to the worthy
Herodotus, he asked the hand of Tomyris, Queen of the Massagetse, in
marriage, and was refused with disdain. He declared war against her to
avenge his wounded vanity, set out to fight with her beyond the Araxes,
in the steppes of Turkestan, defeated the advance-guard of cavalry,
and took prisoner the heir to the crown, Spargapises, who thereupon ran
himself through with his sword. "Then Tomyris collected all the forces
of her kingdom, and gave him (Cyrus) battle." Of all the combats in which
barbarians have engaged among themselves, I reckon this to have been the
fiercest. The following, as I understand, was the manner of it:&mdash;First,
the two armies stood apart and shot their arrows at each other; then,
when their quivers were empty, they closed and fought hand to hand with
lances and daggers; and thus they continued fighting for a length
of time, neither choosing to give ground. At length the Massagetse
prevailed. The greater part of the army of the Persians was destroyed.
Search was made among the slain by order of the queen for the body of
Cyrus; and when it was found, she took a skin, and, filling it full of
human blood, she dipped the head of Cyrus in the gore, saying, as she
thus insulted the corse, "I live and have conquered thee in fight, and
yet by thee am I ruined, for thou tookest my son with guile; but thus I
make good my threat, and give thee thy fill of blood." The engagement
was not as serious as the legend would have us believe, and the growth
of the Persian power was in no way affected, by it. It cost Cyrus his
life, but his army experienced no serious disaster, and his men took
the king's body and brought it to Pasargadæ. He had a palace there, the
remains of which can still be seen on the plain of Murgâb. The edifice
was unpretentious, built upon a rectangular plan, with two porches of
four columns on the longer sides, a lateral chamber at each of the four
angles, and a hypostyle hall in the centre, divided lengthways by two
rows of columns which supported the roof. The walls were decorated with
bas-reliefs, and wherever the inscriptions have not been destroyed,
we can read in cuneiform characters in the three languages which
thenceforward formed the official means of communication of the
empire&mdash;Persian, Medic, and Chaldæan&mdash;the name, title, and family of
the royal occupant. Cyrus himself is represented in a standing posture
on the pilasters, wearing a costume in which Egyptian and Assyrian
features are curiously combined. He is clothed from neck to ankle in the
close-fitting fringed tunic of the Babylonian and Mnevite sovereigns;
his feet are covered with laced boots, while four great wings, emblems
of the supreme power, overshadow his shoulders and loins, two of them
raised in the air, the others pointing to the earth; he wears on
his head the Egyptian skull-cap, from which rises one of the most
complicated head-dresses of the royal wardrobe of the Pharaohs. The
monarch raises his right hand with the gesture of a man speaking to an
assembled people, and as if repeating the legend traced above his image:
"I am Cyrus, the king, the Achæmenian." He was buried not far off, in
the monumental tomb which he had probably built for himself in a square
enclosure, having a portico on three of its sides; a small chamber,
with a ridge roof, rises from a base composed of six receding steps, so
arranged as to appear of unequal height.
</p>


<p>
The doorway is narrow, and so low that a man of medium statue finds some
difficulty in entering. It is surmounted by a hollow moulding, quite
Egyptian in style, and was closed by a two-leaved stone door. The
golden coffin rested on a couch of the same metal, covered with precious
stuffs; and a circular table, laden with drinking-vessels and ornaments
enriched with precious stones, completed the furniture of the chamber.
The body of the conqueror remained undisturbed on this spot for two
centuries under the care of the priests; but while Alexander was waging
war on the Indian frontier, the Greek officers, to whom he had entrusted
the government of Persia proper, allowed themselves to be tempted by the
enormous wealth which the funerary chapel was supposed to contain.

<p>
They opened the coffin, broke the couch and the table, and finding them
too heavy to carry away easily, they contented themselves with stealing
the drinking-vessels and jewels. Alexander on his return visited the
place, and caused the entrance to be closed with a slight wall of
masonry; he intended to restore the monument to its former splendour,
but he himself perished shortly after, and what remained of the
contents probably soon disappeared. After the death of Cyrus, popular
imagination, drawing on the inexhaustible materials furnished by his
adventurous career, seemed to delight in making him the ideal of all
a monarch should be; they attributed to him every virtue&mdash;gentleness,
bravery, moderation, justice, and wisdom. There is no reason to doubt
that he possessed the qualities of a good general&mdash;activity, energy, and
courage, together with the astuteness and the duplicity so necessary to
success in Asiatic conquest&mdash;but he does not appear to have possessed in
the same degree the gifts of a great administrator. He made no changes
in the system of government which from the time of Tiglath-pileser III.
onwards had obtained among all Oriental sovereigns; he placed satraps
over the towns and countries of recent acquisition, at Sardes and
Babylon, in Syria and Palestine, but without clearly defining their
functions or subjecting them to a supervision sufficiently strict to
ensure the faithful performance of their duties. He believed that he was
destined to found a single empire in which all the ancient empires were
to be merged, and he all but carried his task to a successful close:
Egypt alone remained to be conquered when he passed away.
</p>
<p>
His wife Kassandanê, a daughter of Pharnaspes, and an Achæmenian like
himself, had borne him five children; two sons, Cambyses* and Smerdis,**
and three daughters, Atossa, Roxana, and Artystonê.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The Persian form of the name rendered Kambyses by the
     Greeks was Kâbuzîyâ or Kambuzîya. Herodotus calls him the
     son of Kassandanê, and the tradition which he has preserved
     is certainly authentic. Ctesias has erroneously stated that
     his mother was Amytis, the daughter of Astyages, and Dinon,
     also erroneously, the Egyptian women Nitêtis; Diodorus
     Siculus and Strabo make him the son of Meroê.

     ** The original form was Bardiya or Barzîya, "the laudable,"
     and the first Greek transcript known, in Æschylus, is
     Mardos, or, in the scholiasts on the passage, Merdias, which
     has been corrupted into Marphios by Hellanikos and into
     Merges by Pompeius Trogus. The form Smerdis in Herodotus,
     and in the historians who follow him, is the result of a
     mistaken assimilation of the Persian name with the purely
     Greek one of Smerdis or Smerdies.

     *** Herodotus says that Atossa was the daughter of
     Kassandanê, and the position which she held during three
     reigns shows that she must have been so; Justi, however,
     calls her the daughter of Amytis. A second daughter is
     mentioned by Herodotus, the one whom Cambyses killed in
     Egypt by a kick; he gives her no name, but she is probably
     the same as the Roxana who according to Ctesias bore a
     headless child. The youngest, Artystonê, was the favourite
     wife of Darius. Josephus speaks of a fourth daughter of
     Cyrus called Meroê, but without saying who was the mother of
     this princess.
</pre>
<p>
Cambyses was probably born about 558, soon after his father's accession,
and he was his legitimate successor, according to the Persian custom
which assigned the crown to the eldest of the sons born in the purple.
He had been associated, as we have seen, in the Babylonian regal power
immediately after the victory over Nabonidus, and on the eve of his
departure for the fatal campaign against the Massagetse his father,
again in accordance with the Persian law, had appointed him regent. A
later tradition, preserved by Ctesias, relates that on this occasion the
territory had been divided between the two sons: Smerdis, here called
Tanyoxarkes, having received as his share Bactriana, the Khoramnians,
the Parthians, and the Carmanians, under the suzerainty of his brother.
Cambyses, it is clear, inherited the whole empire, but intrigues
gathered round Smerdis, and revolts broke out in the provinces, incited,
so it was said, whether rightly or wrongly, by his partisans.* The new
king was possessed of a violent, merciless temper, and the Persians
subsequently emphasised the fact by saying that Cyrus had been a
father to them, Cambyses a master. The rebellions were repressed with a
vigorous hand, and finally Smerdis disappeared by royal order, and the
secret of his fate was so well kept, that it was believed, even by his
mother and sisters, that he was merely imprisoned in some obscure Median
fortress.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus speaks of peoples subdued by Cambyses in Asia,
     and this allusion can only refer to a revolt occurring after
     the death of Cyrus, before the Egyptian expedition; these
     troubles are explicitly recorded in Xenophon.

     ** The inscription of Behistun says distinctly that Cambyses
     had his brother Bardîya put to death before the Egyptian
     expedition; on the other hand, Herodotus makes the murder
     occur during the Egyptian expedition and Ctesias after this
     expedition. Ctesias' version of the affair adds that
     Cambyses, the better to dissimulate his crime, ordered the
     murderer Sphendadates to pass himself off as Tanyoxarkes, as
     there was a great resemblance between the two: Sphendadates
     &mdash;the historian goes on to say&mdash;was exiled to Bactriana,
     and it was not until five years afterwards that the mother
     of the two princes heard of the murder and of the
     substitution. These additions to the story are subsequent
     developments suggested by the traditional account of the
     Pseudo-Smerdis. In recent times several authorities have
     expressed the opinion that all that is told us of the murder
     of Smerdis and about the Pseudo-Smerdis is merely a legend,
     invented by Darius or those about him in order to justify
     his usurpation in the eyes of the people: the Pseudo-Smerdis
     would be Smerdis himself, who revolted against Cambyses, and
     was then, after he had reigned a few months, assassinated by
     Darius. Winckler acknowledges "that certainty is impossible
     in such a case;" and, in reality, all ancient tradition is
     against his hypothesis, and it is best to accept Herodotus'
     account, with all its contradictions, until contemporaneous
     documents enable us to decide what to accept and what to
     reject in it.
</pre>
<p>
The ground being cleared of his rival, and affairs on the Scythian
frontier reduced to order, Cambyses took up the projects against Egypt
at the exact point at which his predecessor had left them. Amasis, who
for ten years had been expecting an attack, had taken every precaution
in his power against it, and had once more patiently begun to make
overtures of alliance with the Hellenic cities; those on the European
continent did not feel themselves so seriously menaced as to consider it
to their interest to furnish him with any assistance, but the Greeks of
the independent islands, with their chief, Poly crates, tyrant of Samos,
received his advances with alacrity. Polycrates had at his disposal
a considerable fleet, the finest hitherto seen in the waters of the
Ægean, and this, combined with the Egyptian navy, was not any too large
a force to protect the coasts of the Delta, now that the Persians had at
their disposition not only the vessels of the Æolian and Ionian cities,
but those of Phoenicia and Cyprus. A treaty was concluded, bringing
about an exchange of presents and amenities between the two princes
which lasted as long as peace prevailed, but was ruptured at the
critical moment by the action of Polycrates, though not actually through
his own fault. The aristocratic party, whose chiefs were always secretly
plotting his overthrow, had given their adherence to the Persians,
and their conduct became so threatening about the time of the death of
Cyras, that Polycrates had to break his engagements with Egypt in order
to avert a catastrophe.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus laid the blame for the breach of the treaty to
     the King of Egypt, and attributed to his fear of the
     constant good fortune of Polycrates. The lattor's accession
     to power is fixed at about the year 540 by some, by others
     in the year 537, or in the year 533-2; his negotiations with
     Amasis must be placed somewhere during the last fifteen
     years of the Pharaoh.
</pre>
<p>
He made a treaty with the Persian king, and sent a squadron of forty
galleys to join the fleet then being equipped in the Phoenician ports.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus records two opposing traditions: one that the
     Samians joined in the Egyptian campaign, the other that they
     went only as far as the neighbourhood of Karpathos.

Amasis, therefore, when war at last broke out, found himself left
to face the enemy alone. The struggle was inevitable, and all the
inhabitants of the eastern coasts of the Mediterranean had long foreseen
its coming. Without taking into consideration the danger to which the
Persian empire and its Syrian provinces were exposed by the proximity of
a strong and able power such as Egypt, the hardy and warlike character
of Cambyses would naturally have prompted him to make an attempt to
achieve what his predecessors, the warrior-kings of Nineveh and Babylon,
had always failed to accomplish successfully. Policy ruled his line of
action, and was sufficient to explain it, but popular imagination sought
other than the very natural causes which had brought the most ancient
and most recent of the great empires of the world into opposition;
romantic reasons were therefore invented to account for the great drama
which was being enacted, and the details supplied varied considerably,
according as the tradition was current in Asia or Africa. It was said
that a physician lent to Cyrus by Amasis, to treat him for an affection
of the eyes, was the cause of all the evil. The unfortunate man,
detained at Susa and chafing at his exile, was said to have advised
Cambyses to ask for the daughter of Pharaoh in marriage, hoping either
that Amasis would grant the request, and be dishonoured in the eyes
of his subjects for having degraded the solar race by a union with a
barbarian, or that he would boldly refuse, and thus arouse the hatred
of the Persians against himself. Amasis, after a slight hesitation,
substituted Nitêtis, a daughter of Apries, for his own child. It
happened that one day in sport Cambyses addressed the princess by the
name of her supposed father, whereupon she said, "I perceive, O king,
that you have no suspicion of the way in which you have been deceived by
Amasis; he took me, and having dressed me up as his own daughter, sent
me to you. In reality I am the daughter of Apries, who was his lord and
master until the day that he revolted, and, in concert with the rest of
the Egyptians, put his sovereign to death." The deceit which Cambyses
thus discovered had been put upon him irritated him so greatly as to
induce him to turn his arms against Egypt. So ran the Persian account of
the tale, but on the banks of the Nile matters were explained otherwise.
Here it was said that it was to Cyrus himself that Nitêtis had been
married, and that she had borne Cambyses to him; the conquest had thus
been merely a revenge of the legitimate heirs of Psammetichus upon the
usurper, and Cambyses had ascended the throne less as a conqueror than
as a Pharaoh of the line of Apries. It was by this childish fiction that
the Egyptians in their decadence consoled themselves before the stranger
for their loss of power. Always proud of their ancient prowess, but
incapable of imitating the deeds of their forefathers, they none the
less pretended that they could neither be vanquished nor ruled except
by one of themselves, and the story of Nitêtis afforded complete
satisfaction to their vanity. If Cambyses were born of a solar princess,
Persia could not be said to have imposed a barbarian king upon Egypt,
but, on the contrary, that Egypt had cleverly foisted her Pharaoh upon
Persia, and through Persia upon half the universe.
</p>
<p>
One obstacle still separated the two foes&mdash;the desert and the marshes
of the Delta. The distance between the outposts of Pelusium and the
fortress of Ænysos* on the Syrian frontier was scarcely fifty-six miles,
and could be crossed by an army in less than ten days.** Formerly the
width of this strip of desert had been less, but the Assyrians, and
after them the Chaldæans, had vied with each other in laying waste the
country, and the absence of any settled population now rendered the
transit difficult. Cambyses had his head-quarters at Gaza, at the
extreme limit of his own dominions,*** but he was at a loss how to face
this solitary region without incurring the risk of seeing half his men
buried beneath its sands, and his uncertainty was delaying his departure
when a stroke of fortune relieved him from his difficulty.
</p>
<pre>
     * The Ænysos of Herodotus is now Khân Yunes.

     ** In 1799, Napoleon's army left Kattiyeh on the 18th of
     Pluviôse, and was at Gaza on the 7th of Ventose, after
     remaining from the 21st to the 30th of Pluviôse before El-
     Arîsh besieging that place.

     *** This seems to follow from the tradition, according to
     which Cambyses left his treasures at Gaza during the
     Egyptian campaign, and the town was thence called <i>Gaza</i>,
     "the treasury." The etymology is false, but the fact that
     suggested it is probably correct, considering the situation
     of Gaza and the part it must necessarily play in an invasion
     of Egypt.
</pre>
<p>
Phanes of Halicarnassus, one of the mercenaries in the service of Egypt,
a man of shrewd judgment and an able soldier, fell out with Amasis for
some unknown reason, and left him to offer his services to his rival.
This was a serious loss for Egypt, since Phanes possessed considerable
authority over the mercenaries, and was better versed in Egyptian
affairs than any other person. He was pursued and taken within sight of
the Lycian coast, but he treated his captors to wine and escaped from
them while they were intoxicated. He placed Cambyses in communication
with the shêkh of the scattered tribes between Syria and the Delta. The
Arab undertook to furnish the Persian king with guides, as one of his
predecessors had done in years gone by for Esar-haddon, and to station
relays of camels laden with water along the route that the invading army
was to follow. Having taken these precautions, Cambyses entrusted the
cares of government and the regulation of his household to Oropastes,*
one of the Persian magi, and gave the order to march forward.
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus calls this individual Patizeithes, and Dionysius
     of Miletus, who lived a little before Herodotus, gives
     Panzythes as a variant of this name: the variant passed into
     the Syncellus as Pauzythes, but the original form
     Patikhshâyathiya is a title signifying <i>viceroy, regent, or
     minister</i>, answering to the modern Persian <i>Padishah</i>:
     Herodotus, or the author he quotes, has taken the name of
     the office for that of the individual. On the other hand,
     Pompeius Trogus, who drew his information from good sources,
     mentions, side by side with Comètes or Gaumata, his brother
     Oropastes, whose name Ahura-upashta is quite correct, and
     may mean, <i>Him whom Ahura helps</i>. It is generally admitted
     that Pompeius Trogus, or rather Justin, has inverted the
     parts they played, and that his Comètes is the Pseudo-
     Smerdis, and not, as he says, Oropastes; it was, then, the
     latter who was the usurper's brother, and it is his name of
     Oropastes which should be substituted for that of the
     Patizeithes of Herodotus.
</pre>


<p>
On arriving at Pelusium, he learned that his adversary no longer
existed. Amasis had died after a short illness, and was succeeded by his
son Psammetichus III.
</p>
<p>
This change of command, at the most critical moment, was almost in
itself, a disaster. Àmasis, with his consummate experience of men and
things, his intimate knowledge of the resources of Egypt, his talents as
a soldier and a general, his personal prestige, his Hellenic leanings,
commanded the confidence of his own men and the respect of foreigners;
but what could be expected of his unknown successor, and who could say
whether he were equal to the heavy task which fate had assigned to him?
The whole of the Nile valley was a prey to gloomy presentiment.*

     * Psammetichus III. has left us very few monuments, which is
     accounted for by the extreme shortness of his reign. For the
     same reason doubtless several writers of classical times
     have ignored his existence, and have made the conquest of
     Egypt take place under Amasis. Ctesias calls the Pharaoh
     Amyrtseus, and gives the same name to those who rebelled
     against the Persians in his own time, and he had an account
     of the history of the conquest entirely different from that
     of Herodotus.
</pre>
<p>
Egypt was threatened not only, as in the previous century, by the
nations of the Tigris and Euphrates, but all Asia, from the Indus to the
Hellespont, was about to fall on her to crush her. She was destitute
of all human help and allies, and the gods themselves appeared to have
forsaken her. The fellahin, inspired with vague alarm, recognised evil
omens in all around them. Rain is rare in the Thebaid, and storms occur
there only twice or three times in a century: but a few days after the
accession of Psammetichus, a shower of fine rain fell at Thebes, an
event, so it was stated with the exaggeration characteristic of the
bearers of ill news, which had never before occurred.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The inhabitants of the Said have, up to our own time,
     always considered rain in the valley as an ill-omened event.
     They used to say in the beginning of the nineteenth century,
     when speaking of Napoleon's expedition, "We knew that
     misfortune threatened us, because it rained at Luxor shortly
     before the French came." Wilkinson assures us that rain is
     not so rare at Thebes as Herodotus thought: he speaks of
     five or six showers a year, and of a great storm on an
     average every ten years. But even he admits that it is
     confined to the mountain district, and does not reach the
     plain: I never heard of rain at Luxor during the six winters
     that I spent in Upper Egypt.

<p>
Pharaoh hastened to meet the invader with all the men, chariots, and
native bowmen at his disposal, together with his Libyan and Cyrenoan
auxiliaries, and the Ionians, Carians, and Greeks of the isles and
mainland. The battle took place before Pelusium, and was fought on
both sides with brave desperation, since defeat meant servitude for the
Egyptians, and for the Persians, cut off by the desert from possible
retreat, captivity or annihilation. Phanes had been obliged to leave his
children behind him, and Pharaoh included them in his suite, to serve,
if needful, as hostages. The Carians and Ionians, who felt themselves
disgraced by the defection of their captain, called loudly for them just
before the commencement of the action. They were killed immediately in
front of the lines, their father being a powerless onlooker; their blood
was thrown into a cask half full of wine, and the horrible mixture
was drunk by the soldiers, who then furiously charged the enemy's
battalions. The issue of the struggle was for a long time doubtful, but
the Egyptians were inferior in numbers; towards evening their lines gave
way and the flight began.* All was not, however, lost, if Psammetichus
had but followed the example of Taharqa, and defended the passage of the
various canals and arms of the river, disputing the ground inch by inch
with the Persians, and gaining time meanwhile to collect a fresh army.
The king lost his presence of mind, and without attempting to rally what
remained of his regiments, he hastened to take refuge within the White
Wall. Cambyses halted a few days to reduce Pelusium,** and in the mean
time sent a vessel of Mitylene to summon Memphis to capitulate: the
infuriated populace, as soon as they got wind of the message, massacred
the herald and the crew, and dragged their bleeding limbs through the
streets.
</p>
<pre>
     * According to Herodotus, eighty years later the battle-
     field used to be shown covered with bones, and it was said
     that the Egyptians could be distinguished from the Persians
     by the relative hardness of their skulls.

     ** Polysenus hands down a story that Cambyses, in order to
     paralyse the resistance of the besieged, caused cats, dogs,
     ibises, and other sacred animals to march at the head of his
     attacking columns: the Egyptians would not venture to use
     their arms for fear of wounding or killing some of their
     gods.
</pre>
<p>
The city held out for a considerable time; when at length she opened
her gates, the remaining inhabitants of the Said who had hesitated up to
then, hastened to make their submission, and the whole of Egypt as far
as Philae became at one stroke a Persian province. The Libyans did not
wait to be summoned to bring their tribute; Cyrene and Barca followed
their example, but their offerings were so small that the conqueror's
irritation was aroused, and deeming himself mocked, he gave way to his
anger, and instead of accepting them, he threw them to his soldiers with
his own hand (B.C. 525).*
</p>
<pre>
     * The question as to the year in which Egypt was subdued by
     Cambyses has long divided historians: I still agree with
     those who place the conquest in the spring of 525.
</pre>
<p>
This sudden collapse of a power whose exalted position had defied all
attacks for centuries, and the tragic fate of the king who had received
his crown merely to lose it, filled contemporary beholders with
astonishment and pity. It was said that, ten days after the capitulation
of Memphis, the victorious king desired out of sport to test the
endurance of his prisoner. Psammetichus beheld his daughter and the
daughters of his nobles pass before him, half naked, with jars on their
shoulders, and go down to the Nile to fetch water from the river like
common slaves; his son and two thousand young men of the same age, in
chains and with ropes round their necks, also defiled before him on
their way to die as a revenge for the murder of the Mitylenians; yet he
never for a moment lost his royal imperturbability. But when one of
his former companions in pleasure chanced to pass, begging for alms
and clothed in rags, Psammetichus suddenly broke out into weeping, and
lacerated his face in despair. Cambyses, surprised at this excessive
grief in a man who up till then had exhibited such fortitude, demanded
the reason of his conduct. "Son of Cyrus," he replied, "the misfortunes
of my house are too unparalleled to weep over, but not the affliction of
my friend. When a man, on the verge of old age, falls from luxury and
abundance into extreme poverty, one may well lament his fate." When the
speech was reported to Cambyses, he fully recognised the truth of it.
Croesus, who was also present, shed tears, and the Persians round him
were moved with pity. Cambyses, likewise touched, commanded that the
son of the Pharaoh should be saved, but the remission of the sentence
arrived too late. He at all events treated Pharaoh himself with
consideration, and it is possible that he might have replaced him on
the throne, under an oath of vassalage, had he not surprised him in
a conspiracy against his own life. He thereupon obliged him to poison
himself by drinking bulls' blood, and he confided the government of the
Nile valley to a Persian named Aryandes.

No part of the ancient world now remained unconquered except the
semi-fabulous kingdom of Ethiopia in the far-off south. Cities and
monarchies, all the great actors of early times, had been laid in
the dust one after another&mdash;Tyre, Damascus, Carchemish, Urartu, Elam,
Assyria, Jerusalem, Media, the Lydians, Babylon, and finally Egypt; and
the prey they had fought over so fiercely and for so many centuries,
now belonged in its entirety to one master for the first time as far
as memory could reach back into the past. Cambyses, following in the
footsteps of Cyrus, had pursued his victorious way successfully, but
it was another matter to consolidate his conquests and to succeed
in governing within the limits of one empire so many incongruous
elements&mdash;the people of the Caucasus and those of the Nile valley, the
Greeks of the Ægean and the Iranians, the Scythians from beyond the Oxus
and the Semites of the banks of the Euphrates or of the Mediterranean
coast; and time alone would show whether this heritage would not fall to
pieces as quickly as it had been built up. The Asiatic elements of the
empire appeared, at all events for the moment, content with their lot,
and Babylon showed herself more than usually resigned; but Egypt
had never accepted the yoke of the stranger willingly, and the most
fortunate of her Assyrian conquerors had never exercised more than a
passing supremacy over her. Cambyses realised that he would never master
her except by governing her himself for a period of several years, and
by making himself as Egyptian as a Persian could be without offending
his own subjects at home. He adopted the titles of the Pharaohs, their
double cartouche, their royal costume, and their solar filiation; as
much to satisfy his own personal animosity as to conciliate the Egyptian
priests, he repaired to Sais, violated the tomb of Amasis, and burnt the
mummy after offering it every insult.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus gives also a second account, which declares that
     Cambyses thus treated the body, not of Amasis, but of some
     unknown person whom he took for Amasis. The truth of the
     story is generally contested, for the deed would have been,
     as Herodotus himself remarks, contrary to Persian ideas
     about the sanctity of fire. I think that by his cruel
     treatment of the mummy, Cambyses wished to satisfy the
     hatred of the natives against the Greek-loving king, and so
     render himself more acceptable to them. The destruction of
     the mummy entailing that of the soul, his act gave the
     Saitic population a satisfaction similar to that experienced
     by the refined cruelty of those who, a few centuries ago,
     killed their enemies when in a state of deadly sin, and so
     ensure not only their dismissal from this world, but also
     their condemnation in the next.

He removed his troops from the temple of Nît, which they had turned into
a barrack to the horror of the faithful, and restored at his own expense
the damage they had done to the building. He condescended so far as
to receive instruction in the local religion, and was initiated in the
worship of the goddess by the priest Uzaharrîsnîti. This was, after
all, a pursuance of the policy employed by his father towards the
Babylonians, and the projects which he had in view necessitated his
gaining the confidence of the people at all costs. Asia having no more
to offer him, two almost untried fields lay open to his ambition&mdash;Africa
and Europe&mdash;the Greek world and what lay beyond it, the Carthaginian
world and Ethiopia. The necessity of making a final reckoning with Egypt
had at the outset summoned him to Africa, and it was therefore in that
continent that he determined to carry on his conquests. Memphis was
necessarily the base of his operations, the only point from which
he could direct the march of his armies in a westerly or southerly
direction, and at the same time keep in touch with the rest of his
empire, and he would indeed have been imprudent had he neglected
anything which could make him acceptable to its inhabitants. As soon as
he felt he had gained their sympathies, he despatched two expeditions,
one to Carthage and one to Ethiopia. Cyrene had spontaneously offered
him her homage; he now further secured it by sending thither with all
honour Ladikê, the widow of Amasis, and he apparently contemplated
taking advantage of the good will of the Cyrenians to approach Carthage
by sea. The combined fleets of Ionia and Phonicia were without doubt
numerically sufficient for this undertaking, but the Tyrians refused to
serve against their own colonies, and he did not venture to employ the
Greeks alone in waters which were unfamiliar to them. Besides this, the
information which he obtained from those about him convinced him that
the overland route would enable him to reach his destination more surely
if more slowly; it would lead him from the banks of the Nile to the
Oases of the Theban desert, from there to the Ammonians, and thence by
way of the Libyans bordering on the Syrtes and the Liby-phoenicians. He
despatched an advance-guard of fifty thousand men from Thebes to occupy
the Oasis of Ammon and to prepare the various halting-places for
the bulk of the troops. The fate of these men has never been clearly
ascertained. They crossed the Oasis of El-Khargeh and proceeded to
the north-west in the direction of the oracle. The natives afterwards
related that when they had arrived halfway, a sudden storm of wind fell
upon them, and the entire force was buried under mounds of sand during
a halt. Cambyses was forced to take their word; in spite of all his
endeavours, no further news of his troops was forthcoming, except that
they never reached the temple, and that none of the generals or soldiers
ever again saw Egypt (524). The expedition to Ethiopia was not more
successful. Since the retreat of Tanuatamanu, the Pharaohs of Napata had
severed all direct relations with Asia; but on being interfered with
by Psammetichus I. and II., they had repulsed the invaders, and had
maintained their frontier almost within sight of Philæ.* In Nubia proper
they had merely a few outposts stationed in the ruins of the towns of
the Theban period&mdash;at Derr, at Pnubsu, at Wady-Halfa, and at Semneh;
the population again becoming dense and the valley fertile to the
south of this spot. Kush, like Egypt, was divided into two regions
&mdash;To-Qonusît, with its cities of Danguru,** Napata, Asta-muras, and
Barua; and Alo,*** which extended along the White and the Blue Nile
in the plain of Sennaar: the Asmakh, the descendants of the Mashauasha
emigrants of the time of Psammetichus I., dwelt on the southern border
of Alo.
</p>
<pre>
     * The northern boundary of Ethiopia is given us
     approximately by the lists of temples in the inscriptions of
     Harsiatef and of Nastosenen: Pnubsu is mentioned several
     times as receiving gifts from the king, which carries the
     permanent dominion of the Ethiopian kings as far as the
     second cataract.

A number of half-savage tribes, Maditi and Bohrehsa, were settled to
the right and to the left of the territory watered by the Nile, between
Darfur, the mountains of Abyssinia, and the Red Sea; and the
warlike disposition of the Ethiopian kings found in these tribes an
inexhaustible field for obtaining easy victories and abundant spoil.
Many of these sovereigns&mdash;Piônkhi, Alaru, Harsiatef, Nastosenen&mdash;whose
respective positions in the royal line are still undetermined, specially
distinguished themselves in these struggles, but the few monuments
they have left, though bearing witness to their military enterprise and
ability, betray their utter decadence in everything connected with art,
language, and religion. The ancient Egyptian syllabary, adapted to
the needs of a barbarous tongue, had ended by losing its elegance;
architecture was degenerating, and sculpture slowly growing more and
more clumsy in appearance. Some of the work, however, is not wanting in
a certain rude nobility&mdash;as, for instance, the god and goddess carved
side by side in a block of grey granite. Ethiopian worship had become
permeated with strange superstitions, and its creed was degraded,
in spite of the strictness with which the priests supervised
its application and kept watch against every attempt to introduce
innovations. Towards the end of the seventh century some of the families
attached to the temple of Am on at Napata had endeavoured to bring about
a kind of religious reform; among other innovations they adopted the
practice of substituting for the ordinary sacrifice, new rites, the
chief feature of which was the offering of the flesh of the victim raw,
instead of roasted with fire. This custom, which was doubtless borrowed
from the negroes of the Upper Nile, was looked upon as a shameful heresy
by the orthodox. The king repaired in state to the temple of Anion,
seized the priests who professed these seditious beliefs, and burnt them
alive.

The use of raw meat, nevertheless, was not discontinued, and it gained
such ground in the course of ages that even Christianity was unable to
suppress it; up to the present time, the <i>brindê</i>, or piece of beef cut
from the living animal and eaten raw, is considered a delicacy by the
Abyssinians.
</p>

The isolation of the Ethiopians had rather increased than lowered their
reputation among other nations. Their transitory appearance on the
battle-fields of Asia had left a deep impression on the memories of
their opponents. The tenacity they had displayed during their conflict
with Assyria had effaced the remembrance of their defeat. Popular fancy
delighted to extol the wisdom of Sabaco,* and exalted Taharqa to the
first rank among the conquerors of the old world; now that Kush once
more came within the range of vision, it was invested with a share of
all these virtues, and the inquiries Cambyses made concerning it were
calculated to make him believe that he was about to enter on a struggle
with a nation of demigods rather than of men. He was informed that they
were taller, more beautiful, and more vigorous than all other mortals,
that their age was prolonged to one hundred and twenty years and more,
and that they possessed a marvellous fountain whose waters imparted
perpetual youth to then-bodies. There existed near their capital a
meadow, perpetually furnishing an inexhaustible supply of food and
drink; whoever would might partake of this "Table of the Sun," and eat
to his fill.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The eulogy bestowed on him by Herodotus shows the esteem
     in which he was held even in the Saite period; later on he
     seems to have become two persons, and so to have given birth
     to the good Ethiopian king Aktisanes.

     ** Pausanias treats it as a traveller's tale. Heeren thought
     that he saw in Herodotus' account a reference to intercourse
     by signs, so frequent in Africa. The "Table of the Sun"
     would thus have been a kind of market, whither the natives
     would come for their provisions, using exchange to procure
     them. I am inclined rather to believe the story to be a
     recollection, partly of the actual custom of placing meats,
     which the first comer might take, on the tombs in the
     necropolis, partly of the mythical "Meadow of Offerings"
     mentioned in the funerary texts, to which the souls of the
     dead and the gods alike had access. This divine region would
     have transferred to our earth by some folk-tale, like the
     judgment of the dead, the entrance into the solar bark, and
     other similar beliefs.
</pre>
<p>
Gold was so abundant that it was used for common purposes, even for the
chains of their prisoners; but, on the other hand, copper was rare
and much prized. Canibyses despatched some spies chosen from among the
Ichthyophagi of the Bed Sea to explore this region, and acting on the
report they brought back, he left Memphis at the head of an army and
a fleet.* The expedition was partly a success and partly a failure. It
followed the Nile valley as far as Korosko, and then struck across the
desert in the direction of Napata;** but provisions ran short before a
quarter of the march had been achieved, and famine obliged the invaders
to retrace their steps after having endured terrible sufferings.***
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus' text speaks of an army only, but the accounts
     of the wars between Ethiopia and Egypt show that the army
     was always accompanied by the necessary fleet.

     ** It is usually thought that the expedition marched by the
     side of the Nile as far as Napata; to support this theory
     the name of a place mentioned in Pliny is quoted, Cambusis
     at the third cataract, which is supposed to contain the name
     of the conqueror. This town, which is sometimes mentioned by
     the classical geographers, is called Kambiusit in the
     Ethiopie texts, and the form of the name makes its
     connection with the history of Cambyses easy. I think it
     follows, from the text of Herodotus, that the Persians left
     the grassy land, the river-valley, at a given moment, to
     enter the sand, i.e. the desert. Now this is done to-day at
     two points&mdash;near Korosko to rejoin the Nile at Abu-Hammed,
     and near Wady-Halfah to avoid the part of the Nile called
     the "Stony belly," Batn el-Hagar. The Korosko route, being
     the only one suitable for the transit of a body of troops,
     and also the only route known to Herodotus, seems, I think,
     likely to be the one which was followed in the present
     instance; at all events, it fits in best with the fact that
     Cambyses was obliged to retrace his steps hurriedly, when he
     had accomplished hardly a fifth of the journey.

     *** Many modern historians are inclined to assume that
     Cambyses' expedition was completely successful, and that its
     result was the overthrow of the ancient kingdom of Nepata
     and the foundation of that of Meroê. Cambyses would have
     given the new town which he built there the name of his
     sister Meroê. The traditions concerning Cambusis and Meroê
     belong to the Alexandrine era, and rest only on chance
     similarities of sound. With regard to the Ethiopian province
     of the Persian empire and to the Ethiopian neighbours of
     Egypt whom Cambyses subdued, the latter are not necessarily
     Ethiopians of Napata. Herodotus himself says that the
     Ethiopians dwelt in the country above Elephantine, and that
     half of what he calls the island of Takhompsô was inhabited
     by Ethiopians: the subjugated Ethiopians and their country
     plainly correspond with the Dodekaschênos of the Græco-Roman
     era.
</pre>
<p>
Cambyses had to rest content with the acquisition of those portions of
Nubia adjoining the first cataract&mdash;the same, in fact, that had been
annexed to Egypt by Psammetichus I. and II. (523). The failure of this
expedition to the south, following so closely on the disaster which
befell that of the west, had a deplorable effect on the mind of
Cambyses. He had been subject, from childhood, to attacks of epilepsy,
during which he became a maniac and had no control over his actions.
These reverses of fortune aggravated the disease, and increased the
frequency and length of the attacks.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Recent historians admit neither the reality of the illness
     of Cambyses nor the madness resulting from it, but consider
     them Egyptian fables, invented out of spite towards the king
     who had conquered and persecuted them.
</pre>
<p>
The bull Apis had died shortly before the close of the Ethiopian
campaign, and the Egyptians, after mourning for him during the
prescribed number of weeks, were bringing his successor with rejoicings
into the temple of Phtah, when the remains of the army re-entered
Memphis. Cambyses, finding the city holiday-making, imagined that it was
rejoicing over his misfortunes. He summoned the magistrates before him,
and gave them over to the executioner without deigning to listen to
their explanations. He next caused the priests to be brought to him, and
when they had paraded the Apis before him, he plunged his dagger into
its flank with derisive laughter: "Ah, evil people! So you make for
yourselves divinities of flesh and blood which fear the sword! It is
indeed a fine god that you Egyptians have here; I will have you to know,
however, that you shall not rejoice overmuch at having deceived me!" The
priests were beaten as impostors, and the bull languished from its wound
and died in a few days*1 its priests buried it, and chose another in its
place without the usual ceremonies, so as not to exasperate the anger
of the tyrant,** but the horror evoked by this double sacrilege raised
passions against Cambyses which the ruin of the country had failed to
excite.
</p>
<pre>
     * Later historians improved upon the account of Herodotus,
     and it is said in the <i>De Iside</i>, that Cambyses killed the
     Apis and threw him to the dogs. Here there is probably a
     confusion between the conduct of Cambyses and that
     attributed to the eunuch Bagoas nearly two centuries later,
     at the time of the second conquest of Egypt by Ochus.

     ** Mariette discovered in the Serapseum and sent to the
     Louvre fragments of the epitaph of an Apis buried in Epiphi
     in the sixth year of Cambyses, which had therefore died a
     few months previously. This fact contradicts the inference
     from the epitaph of the Apis that died in the fourth year of
     Darius, which would have been born in the fifth year of
     Cambyses, if we allow that there could not have been two
     Apises in Egypt at once. This was, indeed, the usual rule,
     but a comparison of the two dates shows that here it was not
     followed, and it is therefore simplest, until we have
     further evidence, to conclude that at all events in cases of
     violence, such as sacrilegious murder, there could have been
     two Apises at once, one discharging his functions, and the
     other unknown, living still in the midst of the herds.
</pre>
<p>
The manifestations of this antipathy irritated him to such an extent
that he completely changed his policy, and set himself from that time
forward to act counter to the customs and prejudices of the Egyptians.
They consequently regarded his memory with a vindictive hatred. The
people related that the gods had struck him with madness to avenge the
murder of the Apis, and they attributed to him numberless traits of
senseless cruelty, in which we can scarcely distinguish truth from
fiction. It was said that, having entered the temple of Phtah, he had
ridiculed the grotesque figure under which the god was represented,
and had commanded the statues to be burnt. On another occasion he had
ordered the ancient sepulchres to be opened, that he might see what was
the appearance of the mummies. The most faithful members of his family
and household, it was said, did not escape his fury. He killed his own
sister Roxana, whom he had married, by a kick in the abdomen; he slew
the son of Prexaspes with an arrow; he buried alive twelve influential
Persians; he condemned Croesus to death, and then repented, but punished
the officers who had failed to execute the sentence pronounced against
the Lydian king.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The whole of this story of Croesus is entirely fabulous.
</pre>
<p>
He had no longer any reason for remaining in Egypt, since he had failed
in his undertakings; yet he did not quit the country, and through
repeated delays his departure was retarded a whole year. Meanwhile his
long sojourn in Africa, the report of his failures, and perhaps whispers
of his insanity, had sown the seeds of discontent in Asia; and as Darius
said in after-years, when recounting these events, "untruth had spread
all over the country, not only in Persia and Media, but in other
provinces." Cambyses himself felt that a longer absence would be
injurious to his interests; he therefore crossed the isthmus in the
spring of 521, and was making his way through Northern Syria, perhaps
in the neighbourhood of Hamath,* when he learned that a revolution had
broken out, and that its rapid progress threatened the safety of his
throne and life.

     * Herodotus calls the place where Cambyses died Agbatana
     (Ecbatana). Pliny says that the town of Carmel was thus
     named at first; but the place here mentioned cannot well
     have been in that direction. It has been identified with
     Batansea in the country between the Orontes and the
     Euphrates, but the most likely theory is the one suggested
     by a passage in Stephen of Byzantium, that the place in
     question is the large Syrian city of Hamath. Josephus makes
     him die at Damascus.
</pre>
<p>
Tradition asserted that a herald appeared before him and proclaimed
aloud, in the hearing of the whole army, that Cambyses, son of Cyrus,
had ceased to reign, and summoned whoever had till that day obeyed him
to acknowledge henceforth Smerdis, son of Cyrus, as their lord. Cambyses
at first believed that his brother had been spared by the assassins, and
now, after years of concealment, had at length declared himself; but he
soon received proofs that his orders had been faithfully accomplished,
and it is said that he wept at the remembrance of the fruitless crime.
The usurper was Gaumâta, one of the Persian Magi, whose resemblance
to Smerdis was so remarkable that even those who were cognisant of it
invariably mistook the one for the other,* and he was brother to that
Oropastes to whom Cambyses had entrusted the administration of his
household before setting out for Egypt.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Greek tradition is unanimous on this point, but the
     inscription of Behistun does not mention it.

     ** The inscription of Behistun informs us that the usurper's
     name was Gaumâta. Pompeius Trogus alone, probably following
     some author who made use of Charon of Lampsacus, handed down
     this name in the form Comètes or Gometes, which his
     abbreviator Justin carelessly applied to the second brother.
     Ctesias gives the Mage the name Sphendadates, which answers
     to the Old Persian Spentôdâta, "he who is given by the Holy
     One," i.e. by Ahura-mazdâ. The supporters of the Mage gave
     him this name, as an heroic champion of the Mazdoan faith
     who had destroyed such sanctuaries as were illegal, and
     identified him with Spentôdâta, son of Wistâspa.
</pre>
<p>
Both of them were aware of the fate of Smerdis; they also knew that the
Persians were ignorant of it, and that every one at court, including
the mother and sisters of the prince, believed that he was still alive.
Gaumâta headed a revolt in the little town of Pasyauvadâ on the 14th
of Viyakhna, in the early days of March, 521, and he was hailed by the
common people from the moment of his appearance. Persia, Media, and the
Iranian provinces pronounced in his favour, and solemnly enthroned him
three months later, on the 9th of Garmapada; Babylon next accepted him,
followed by Elam and the regions of the Tigris. Though astounded at
first by such a widespread defection, Cambyses soon recovered his
presence of mind, and was about to march forward at the head of the
troops who were still loyal to him, when he mysteriously disappeared.
Whether he was the victim of a plot set on foot by those about him, is
not known. The official version of the story given by Darius states
that he died by his own hand, and it seems to insinuate that it was
a voluntary act, but another account affirms that he succumbed to an
accident;* while mounting his horse, the point of his dagger pierced
his thigh in the same spot in which he had stabbed the Apis of the
Egyptians. Feeling himself seriously wounded, he suddenly asked the
name of the place where he was lying, and was told it was "Agbatana"
(Ecbatana). "Now, long before this, the oracle of Buto had predicted
that he should end his days in Agbatana, and he, believing it to be the
Agbatana in Media where were his treasures, understood that he should
die there in his old age; whereas the oracle meant Agbatana in Syria.
When he heard the name, he perceived his error. He understood what the
god intended, and cried, 'It is here, then, that Cambyses, son of Cyrus,
must perish!'" He expired about three weeks after, leaving no posterity
and having appointed no successor.**
</p>
<pre>
     * It has been pointed out, for the purpose of harmonising
     the testimony of Herodotus with that of the inscription of
     Behistun, that although the latter speaks of the death of
     Cambyses by his own hand, it does not say whether that death
     was voluntary or accidental.

     ** The story of a person whose death has been predicted to
     take place in some well-known place, and who has died in
     some obscure spot of the same name, occurs several times in
     different historians, e.g. in the account of the Emperor
     Julian, and in that of Henry III. of England, who had been
     told that he would die in Jerusalem, and whose death took
     place in the Jerusalem Chamber at Westminster. Ctesias has
     preserved an altogether different tradition&mdash;that Cambyses
     on his return from Babylon wounded himself while carving a
     piece of wood for his amusement, and died eleven days after
     the accident.
</pre>
<p>
What took place in the ensuing months still remains an enigma to us.
The episode of Gaumâta has often been looked on as a national movement,
which momentarily restored to the Medes the supremacy of which Cyrus had
robbed them; but it was nothing of the sort. Gaumâta was not a Mede by
birth: he was a Persian, born in Persia, in the township of Pisyauvadâ,
at the foot of Mount Ara-kadrish, and the Persians recognised and
supported him as much as did the Medes. It has also been thought that
he had attempted to foment a religious revolution,* and, as a matter of
fact, he destroyed several temples in a few months.
</p>
<pre>
     * Most of the ancient writers shared this opinion, and have
     been followed therein by many modern writers. Rawlinson was
     the first to show that Gaumâta's movement was not Median,
     and that he did not in the least alter the position of the
     Persians in the empire: but he allows the Magian usurpation
     to have been the prelude to a sort of religious reform.
</pre>
<p>
Here, however, the reform touched less upon a question of belief than on
one of fact. The unity of the empire presupposed the unity of the royal
fire, and where-ever that fire was burning another could not be lighted
without sacrilege in the eyes of the faithful. The pyres that Gaumâta
desired to extinguish were, no doubt, those which the feudal families
had maintained for their separate use in defiance of the law, and the
measure which abolished them had a political as well as a religious
side. The little we can glean of the line of action adopted by Smerdis
does not warrant the attribution to him of the vast projects which
some modern writers credit him with. He naturally sought to strengthen
himself on the throne, which by a stroke of good fortune he had
ascended, and whatever he did tended solely to this end. The name and
the character that he had assumed secured him the respect and fidelity
of the Iranians: "there was not one, either among the Medes or the
Persians, nor among the members of the Achæmenian race, who dreamed of
disputing his power" in the early days of his reign. The important thing
in his eyes was, therefore, to maintain among his subjects as long as
possible the error as to his identity. He put to death all, whether
small or great, who had been in any way implicated in the affairs of the
real Smerdis, or whom he suspected of any knowledge of the murder. He
withdrew from public life as far as practicable, and rarely allowed
himself to be seen. Having inherited the harem of his predecessors,
together with their crown, he even went so far as to condemn his wives
to a complete seclusion. He did not venture to hope, nor did those in
his confidence, that the truth would not one day be known, but he hoped
to gain, without loss of time, sufficient popularity to prevent the
revelation of the imposture from damaging his prospects. The seven great
houses which he had dispossessed would, in such a case, refuse to
rally round him, and it was doubtless to lessen their prestige that he
extinguished their pyres; but the people did not trouble themselves as
to the origin of their sovereign, if he showed them his favour and took
proper precautions to secure their good will. He therefore exempted the
provinces from taxes and military service for a period of three years.
He had not time to pursue this policy, and if we may believe tradition,
the very precautions which he took to conceal his identity became the
cause of his misfortunes. In the royal harem there were, together with
the daughters of Cyrus, relatives of all the Persian nobility, and the
order issued to stop all their communications with the outer world had
excited suspicion: the avowals which had escaped Cambyses before the
catastrophe were now called to mind, and it was not long before those
in high places became convinced that they had been the dupes of an
audacious imposture. A conspiracy broke out, under the leadership of the
chiefs of the seven clans, among whom was numbered Darius, the son of
Hystaspes, who was connected, according to a genealogy more or less
authentic, with the family of the Achæmenides:* the conspirators
surprised Gaumâta in his palace of Sikayauvatish, which was situated in
the district of Nisaya, not far from Ecbatana, and assassinated him on
the 10th of Bâgayâdîsh, 521 B.C.
</p>
<pre>
     * The passage in the Behistun inscription, in which Darius
     sets forth his own genealogy, has received various
     interpretations. That of Oppert seems still the most
     probable, that the text indicates two parallel branches of
     Achæmenides, which nourished side by side until Cambyses
     died and Darius ascended the throne. Such a genealogy,
     however, appears to be fictitious, invented solely for the
     purpose of connecting Darius with the ancient royal line,
     with which in reality he could claim no kinship, or only a
     very distant connection.

<p>
The exact particulars of this scene were never known, but popular
imagination soon supplied the defect, furnishing a full and complete
account of all that took place. In the first place, Phædimê, daughter
of Otanes, one of the seven, furnished an authentic proof of the fraud
which had been perpetrated. Her father had opportunely recalled the
marvellous resemblance between Smerdis and the Magian, and remembered
at the same time that the latter had been deprived of his ears in
punishment for some misdeed: he therefore sent certain instructions to
Phffidimê, who, when she made the discovery, at the peril of her life,
that her husband had no ears, communicated the information to the
disaffected nobles. The conspirators thereupon resolved to act without
delay; but when they arrived at the palace, they were greeted with an
extraordinary piece of intelligence. The Magi, disquieted by some vague
rumours which were being circulated against them, had besought Prexaspes
to proclaim to the people that the reigning monarch was indeed Smerdis
himself. But Prexaspes, instead of making the desired declaration,
informed the multitude that the son of Cyrus was indeed dead, for he
himself had murdered him at the bidding of Cambyses, and, having
made this confession, he put himself to death, in order to escape
the vengeance of the Magi. This act of Prexaspes was an additional
inducement to the conspirators to execute their purpose. The guard
stationed at the gates of the palace dared not refuse admission to so
noble a company, and when the throne-room was reached and the eunuchs
forbade further advance, the seven boldly drew their swords and forced
their way to the apartment occupied by the two Magi. The usurpers
defended themselves with bravery, but succumbed at length to the
superior number of their opponents, after having wounded two of the
conspirators. Gobryas pinioned Gaumâta with his arms, and in such a way
that Darius hesitated to make the fatal thrust for fear of wounding
his comrade; but the latter bade him strike at all hazards, and by good
fortune the sword did not even graze him. The crime accomplished, the
seven conspirators agreed to choose as king that member of their company
whose horse should first neigh after sunrise: a stratagem of his groom
caused the election to fall on Darius. As soon as he was duly enthroned,
he instituted a festival called the "magophonia," or "massacre of the
Magi," in commemoration of the murder which had given him the crown.
</p>
<p>
His first care was to recompense the nobles to whom he owed his position
by restoring to them the privileges of which they had been deprived by
the pseudo-Smerdis, namely, the right of free access to the king, as
well as the right of each individual to a funeral pyre; but the usurper
had won the affection of the people, and even the inhabitants of those
countries which had been longest subject to the Persian sway did not
receive the new sovereign favourably. Darius found himself, therefore,
under the necessity of conquering his dominions one after the other.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The history of the early part of the reign of Darius is
     recorded in the great inscription which the king caused to
     be cut in three languages on the rocks of Behistun. The
     order of the events recorded in it is not always easy to
     determine. I have finally adopted, with some modifications,
     the arrangement of Marquart, which seems to me to give the
     clearest "conspectus" of these confused wars.
</pre>
<p>
The Persian empire, like those of the Chaldæans and Medes, had consisted
hitherto of nothing but a fortuitous collection of provinces under
military rule, of vassal kingdoms, and of semi-independent cities and
tribes; there was no fixed division of authority, and no regular system
of government for the outlying provinces. The governors assigned by
Cyrus and Cambyses to rule the various provinces acquired by conquest,
were actual viceroys, possessing full control of an army, and in some
cases of a fleet as well, having at their disposal considerable revenues
both in money and in kind, and habituated, owing to their distance from
the capital, to settle pressing questions on their own responsibility,
subject only to the necessity of making a report to the sovereign when
the affair was concluded, or when the local resources were insufficient
to bring it to a successful issue. For such free administrators the
temptation must have been irresistible to break the last slender ties
which bound them to the empire, and to set themselves up as independent
monarchs. The two successive revolutions which had taken place in less
than a year, convinced such governors, and the nations over which they
bore rule, that the stately edifice erected by Cyrus and Cambyses was
crumbling to pieces, and that the moment was propitious for each of them
to carve out of its ruins a kingdom for himself; the news of the murder,
rapidly propagated, sowed the seeds of revolt in its course&mdash;in Susiana,
at Babylon, in Media, in Parthia, in Margiana, among the Sattagydes,
in Asia Minor, and even in Egypt itself*&mdash;which showed itself in
some places in an open and undisguised form, while in others it was
contemptuously veiled under the appearance of neutrality, or the
pretence of waiting to see the issue of events.
</p>
<pre>
     * In the <i>Behistun Inscription</i>, it is stated that
     insurrections broke out in all these countries while Darius
     was at Babylon; that is to say, while he was occupied in
     besieging that city, as is evident from the order of the
     events narrated.
</pre>
<p>
The first to break out into open rebellion were the neighbouring
countries of Elam and Chaldæa: the death of Smerdis took place towards
the end of September, and a fortnight later saw two rebel chiefs
enthroned&mdash;a certain Athrîna at Susa, and a Nadinta-bel at Babylon.*
Athrîna, the son of Umbadaranma, was a scion of the dynasty dispossessed
by the successors of Sargon in the preceding century, but nevertheless
he met with but lukewarm assistance from his own countrymen;** he was
taken prisoner before a month had passed, and sent to Darius, who slew
him with his own hand.
</p>
<pre>
     * The latest known document of the pseudo-Smerdis is dated
     the 1st of Tisri at Babylon, and the first of Nebuchadrezzar
     III. are dated the 17th and 20th of the same month. The
     revolt of Babylon, then, must be placed between the 1st and
     17th of Tisri; that is, either at the end of September or
     the beginning of October, 521 B.C.

     ** The revolt cannot have lasted much more than six weeks,
     for on the 26th of Athriyâdiya following, that is to say, at
     the beginning of December, Darius had already joined issue
     with the Babylonians on the banks of the Tigris.
</pre>
<p>
Babylon was not so easily mastered. Her chosen sovereign claimed to
be the son of Nabonidus, and had, on ascending the throne, assumed the
illustrious name of Nebuchadrezzar; he was not supported, moreover, by
only a few busybodies, but carried the whole population with him. The
Babylonians, who had at first welcomed Cyrus so warmly, and had fondly
imagined that they had made him one of themselves, as they had made
so many of their conquerors for centuries past, soon realised their
mistake. The differences of language, manners, spirit, and religion
between themselves and the Persians were too fundamental to allow of
the naturalisation of the new sovereign, and of the acceptance by
the Achæmenides of that fiction of a double personality to which
Tiglath-pileser III., Shalmaneser, and even Assur-bani-pal had
submitted. Popular fancy grew weary of Cyrus, as it had already grown
weary in turn of all the foreigners it had at first acclaimed&mdash;whether
Elamite, Kaldâ, or Assyrian&mdash;and by a national reaction the self-styled
son of Nabonidus enjoyed the benefit of a devotion proportionately as
great as the hatred which had been felt twenty years before for his
pretended sire. The situation might become serious if he were given time
to consolidate his power, for the loyalty of the ancient provinces of
the Chaldæan empire was wavering, and there was no security that they
would not feel inclined to follow the example of the capital as soon
as they should receive news of the sedition. Darius, therefore, led
the bulk of his forces to Babylon without a day's more delay than was
absolutely necessary, and the event proved that he had good reason for
such haste. Nebuchadrezzar III. had taken advantage of the few weeks
which had elapsed since his accession, to garrison the same positions
on the right bank of the Tigris, as Nabonidus had endeavoured to defend
against Cyrus at the northern end of the fortifications erected by his
ancestor. A well-equipped flotilla patrolled the river, and his lines
presented so formidable a front that Darius could not venture on a
direct attack. He arranged his troops in two divisions, which he mounted
partly on horses, partly on camels, and eluding the vigilance of his
adversary by attacking him simultaneously on many sides, succeeded in
gaining the opposite bank of the river. The Chaldæans, striving in vain
to drive him back into the stream, were at length defeated on the 27th
of Athriyâdiya, and they retired in good order on Babylon. Six days
later, on the 2nd of Anâmaka, they fought a second battle at Zazanu,
on the bank of the Euphrates, and were again totally defeated.
Nebuchadrezzar escaped with a handful of cavalry, and hastened to shut
himself up in his city. Darius soon followed him, but if he cherished a
hope that the Babylonians would open their gates to him without further
resistance, as they had done to Cyrus, he met with a disappointment,
for he was compelled to commence a regular siege and suspend all other
operations, and that, too, at a moment when the provinces were breaking
out into open insurrection on every hand.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The account given by Darius seems to imply that no
     interval of time elapsed between the second defeat of
     Nebuchadrezzar III. and the taking of Babylon, so that
     several modern historians have rejected the idea of an
     obstinate resistance. Herodotus, however, speaks of the long
     siege the city sustained, and the discovery of tablets dated
     in the first and even the second year of Nebuchadrezzar III.
     shows that the siege was prolonged into the second year of
     this usurper, at least until the month of Nisân (March-
     April), 520 B.C. No evidence can be drawn from the tablets
     dated in the reign of Darius, for the oldest yet discovered,
     which is dated in the month Sebat (Jan.-Feb.), in the year
     of his accession, and consequently prior to the second year
     of Nebuchadrezzar, comes from Abu-habba. On the other hand,
     the statement that all the revolts broke out while Darius
     was "at Babylon" does not allow of the supposition that all
     the events recorded before his departure for Media could
     have been compressed into the space of three or four months.
     It seems, therefore, more probable that the siege lasted
     till 519 B.C., as it can well have done if credit be given
     to the mention of "twenty-one months at least" by Herodotus;
     perhaps the siege was brought to an end in the May of that
     year, as calculated by Marquart.

<p>
The attempt of the Persian adventurer Martîya to stir up the Susians to
revolt in his rear failed, thanks to the favourable disposition of the
natives, who refused to recognise in him Ummanîsh, the heir of
their national princes. Media, however, yielded unfortunately to the
solicitations of a certain Fravartîsh, who had assumed the personality
of Khshatrita of the race of Cyaxares, and its revolt marked almost the
beginning of a total break-up of the empire. The memory of Astyages and
Cyaxares had not yet faded so completely as to cause the Median nobles
to relinquish the hope of reasserting the supremacy of Media; the
opportunity for accomplishing this aim now seemed all the more
favourable, from the fact that Darius had been obliged to leave this
province almost immediately after the assassination of the Usurper, and
to take from it all the troops that he could muster for the siege of
Babylon. Several of the nomadic tribes still remained faithful to him,
but all the settled inhabitants of Media ranged themselves under the
banner of the pretender, and the spirit of insurrection spread thereupon
into Armenia and Assyria. For one moment there was a fear lest it should
extend to Asia Minor also, where Orcetes, accustomed, in the absence of
Cambyses, to act as an autonomous sovereign, displayed little zeal in
accommodating himself to the new order of things. There was so much
uncertainty as to the leanings of the Persian guard of Orcetes, that
Darius did not venture to degrade the satrap officially, but despatched
Bagseus to Sardes with precise instructions, which enabled him to
accomplish his mission by degrees, so as not to risk a Lydian revolt.
His first act was to show the guard a rescript by which they were
relieved from attendance on Orcetes, and "thereupon they immediately
laid down their spears." Emboldened by their ready obedience, Bagseus
presented to the secretary a second letter, which contained his
instructions: "The great king commands those Persians who are in Sardes
to kill Orestes." "Whereupon," it is recorded, "they drew their swords
and slew him."*
</p>
<pre>
     * The context of Herodotus indicates that the events
     narrated took place shortly after the accession of Darius.
     Further on Herodotus mentions, as contemporaneous with the
     siege of Babylon, events which took place after the death of
     Orcetes; it is probable, therefore, that the scene described
     by Herodotus occurred in 520 B.C. at the latest.
</pre>
<p>
A revolt in Asia Minor was thus averted, at a time when civil war
continued to rage in the centre of Iran. The situation, however,
continued critical. Darius could not think of abandoning the siege of
Babylon, and of thus both losing the fruits of his victories and seeing
Nebuchadrezzar reappear in Assyria or Susiana. On the other hand, his
army was a small one, and he would incur great risks in detaching any of
his military chiefs for a campaign against the Mede with an insufficient
force. He decided, however, to adopt the latter course, and while he
himself presided over the blockade, he simultaneously despatched two
columns&mdash;one to Media, under the command of the Persian Vidarna, one of
the seven; the other to Armenia, under the Armenian Dâdarshîsh. Vidarna,
encountered Khshatrita near Marush, in the mountainous region of the
old Namri, on the 27th of Anâmaka, and gave him battle; but though he
claimed the victory, the result was so indecisive that he halted in
Kambadênê, at the entrance to the gorges of the Zagros mountains, and
was there obliged to await reinforcements before advancing further.
Dâdarshîsh, on his side, gained three victories over the Armenians&mdash;one
near Zuzza on the 8th of Thuravâhara, another at Tigra ten days later,
and the third on the 2nd of Thâigarshîsh, at a place not far from
Uhyâma&mdash;but he also was compelled to suspend operations and remain
inactive pending the arrival of fresh troops. Half the year was spent in
inaction on either side, for the rebels had not suffered less than their
opponents, and, while endeavouring to reorganise their forces, they
opened negotiations with the provinces of the north-east with the view
of prevailing on them to join their cause. Darius, still detained before
Babylon, was unable to recommence hostilities until the end of 520
B.C. He sent Vaumisa to replace Dâdarshîsh as the head of the army in
Armenia, and the new general distinguished himself at the outset by
winning a decisive victory on the 15th of Anâmaka, near Izitush in
Assyria; but the effect which he hoped to secure from this success was
neutralised almost immediately by grievous defections. Sagartia, in the
first place, rose in rebellion at the call of a pretended descendant
of Oyaxares, named Chitrantakhma; Hyrcania, the province governed by
Hystaspes, the father of Darius, followed suit and took up the cause
of Khshatrita, and soon after Margiana broke out into revolt at the
instigation of a certain Frâda. Even Persia itself deserted Darius, and
chose another king instead of a sovereign whom no one seemed willing to
acknowledge. Many of the mountain tribes could not yet resign themselves
to the belief that the male line of Cyrus had become extinct with the
death of Cambyses. The usurpation of Gaumâta and the accession of Darius
had not quenched their faith in the existence of Smerdis: if the Magian
were an impostor, it did not necessarily follow that Smerdis had been
assassinated, and when a certain Vahyazdâta rose up in the town of
Târavâ in the district of Yautiyâ, and announced himself as the younger
son of Cyrus, they received him with enthusiastic acclamations. A
preliminary success gained by Hystaspes at Vispauzatîsh, in Parthia, on
the 22nd of Viyakhna, 519 B.C., prevented the guerilla bands of Hyrcania
from joining forces with the Medes, and some days later the fall of
Babylon at length set Darius free to utilise his resources to the
utmost. The long resistance of Nebuchadrezzar furnished a fruitful theme
for legend: a fanciful story was soon substituted for the true account
of the memorable siege he had sustained. Half a century later, when
his very name was forgotten, the heroism of his people continued to
be extolled beyond measure. When Darius arrived before the ramparts he
found the country a desert, the banks of the canals cut through, and the
gardens and pleasure-houses destroyed. The crops had been gathered and
the herds driven within the walls of the city, while the garrison had
reduced by a massacre the number of non-combatants, the women having all
been strangled, with the exception of those who were needed to bake the
bread. At the end of twenty months the siege seemed no nearer to its
close than at the outset, and the besiegers were on the point of losing
heart, when at length Zopyrus, one of the seven, sacrificed himself
for the success of the blockading army. Slitting his nose and ears, and
lacerating his back with the lash of a whip, he made his way into the
city as a deserter, and persuaded the garrison to assign him a post of
danger under pretence of avenging the ill-treatment he had received
from his former master. He directed some successful sallies on points
previously agreed upon, and having thus lulled to rest any remaining
feelings of distrust on the part of the garrison, he treacherously
opened to the Persians the two gates of which he was in charge; three
thousand Babylonians were impaled, the walls were razed to the ground,
and the survivors of the struggle were exiled and replaced by strange
colonists.* The only authentic fact about this story is the length of
the siege. Nebuchadrezzar was put to death, and Darius, at length
free to act, hastened to despatch one of his lieutenants, the Persian
Artavardiya, against Vahyazdâta, while he himself marched upon the Medes
with the main body of the royal army.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Ctesias places the siege of Babylon forty years later,
     under Xerxes I.; according to him, it was Megabysus, son of
     Zopyrus, who betrayed the city. Polysenus asserts that the
     stratagem of Zopyrus was adopted in imitation of a Sakian
     who dwelt beyond the Oxus. Latin writers transferred the
     story to Italy, and localised it at Gabii: but the Roman
     hero, Sextus Tarquinius, did not carry his devotion to the
     point of mutilating himself.

     ** <i>Beldstun Inscr</i>.: "Then I sent the army of the Persians
     and Medes which was with me. One named Artavardiya, a
     Persian, my servant, I made their general; the rest of the
     Persian army went to Media with me."
</pre>
<p>
The rebels had hitherto been confronted by the local militia, brave
but inexperienced troops, with whom they had been able to contend on a
fairly equal footing: the entry into the field of the veteran regiments
of Cyrus and Cambyses changed the aspect of affairs, and promptly
brought the campaign to a successful issue. Darius entered Media by
the defiles of Kerend, reinforced Vidarna in Kambadçnê, and crushed the
enemy near the town of Kundurush, on the 20th of Adukanîsh, 519 B.C.
Khshatrita fled towards the north with some few horsemen, doubtless
hoping to reach the recesses of Mount Elburz, and to continue there
the struggle; but he was captured at Bagâ and carried to Ecbatana. His
horrible punishment was proportionate to the fear he had inspired: his
nose, ears, and tongue were cut off, and his eyes gouged out, and in
this mutilated condition he was placed in chains at the gate of the
palace, to demonstrate to his former subjects how the Achæmenian'
king could punish an impostor. When the people had laid this lesson
sufficiently to heart, Khshatrita was impaled; many of his principal
adherents were ranged around him and suffered the same fate, while
the rest were decapitated as an example. Babylon and Media being thus
successfully vanquished, the possession of the empire was assured to
Darius, whatever might happen in other parts of his territory, and
henceforth the process of repressing disaffection went on unchecked.
Immediately after the decisive battle of Kundurush, Vaumisa accomplished
the pacification of Armenia by a victory won near Autiyâra, and
Artavardiya defeated Vahyazdâta for the first time at Eakhâ in Persia.
Vahyazdâta had committed the mistake of dividing his forces and sending
a portion of them to Arachosia. Vivâna, the governor of this province,
twice crushed the invaders, and almost at the same time the Persian
Dâdardîsh of Bactriana was triumphing over Frâda and winning Margiana
back to allegiance. For a moment it seemed as if the decisive issue of
the struggle might be prolonged for months, since it was announced that
the appearance of a new pseudo-Smerdis on the scene had been followed
by the advent of a second pseudo-Nebuchadrezzar in Chaldæa. Darius left
only a weak garrison at Babylon when he started to attack Khshatrita:
a certain Arakha, an Armenian by birth, presenting himself to the
Babylonian people as the son of Nabonidus, caused himself to be
proclaimed king in December, 519 B.C.; but the city was still suffering
so severely from the miseries of the long siege, that it was easy for
the Mede Vindafrâ to reduce it promptly to submission after a month or
six weeks of semi-independence. This was the last attempt at revolt.
Chitran-takhma expiated his crimes by being impaled, and Hystaspes
routed the Hyrcanian battalions at Patigrabana in Parthia: Artavardiya
having defeated Vahyazdâta, near Mount Paraga, on the 6th of Garmapada,
618 B.C., besieged him in his fortress of Uvâdeshaya, and was not long
in effecting his capture. The civil war came thus to an end.
</p>
<p>
It had been severe, but it had brought into such prominence the
qualities of the sovereign that no one henceforth dared to dispute his
possession of the crown. A man of less energetic character and calm
judgment would have lost his head at the beginning of the struggle, when
almost every successive week brought him news of a fresh rebellion&mdash;in
Susiana, Babylon, Media, Armenia, Assyria, Margiana, Hyrcania, and even
Persia itself, not to speak of the intrigues in Asia Minor and Egypt;
he would have scattered his forces to meet the dangers on all sides
at once, and would assuredly have either succumbed in the struggle, or
succeeded only by chance after his fate had trembled in the balance for
years. Darius, however, from the very beginning knew how to single out
the important points upon which to deal such vigorous blows as would
ensure him the victory with the least possible delay. He saw that
Babylon, with its numerous population, its immense wealth and prestige,
and its memory of recent supremacy, was the real danger to his empire,
and he never relaxed his hold on it until it was subdued, leaving
his generals to deal with the other nations, the Medes included, and
satisfied if each of them could but hold his adversary in check
without gaining any decided advantage over him. The event justified his
decision. When once Babylon had fallen, the remaining rebels were
no longer a source of fear; to defeat Khshatrita was the work of a
few weeks only, and the submission of the other provinces followed as a
natural consequence on the ruin of Media.*

There his figure is still to be seen standing, with his foot resting on
the prostrate body of an enemy, and his hand raised in the attitude of
one addressing an audience, while nine figures march in file to meet
him, their arms tied behind their backs, and cords round their
necks, representing all the pretenders whom he had fought and put
to death&mdash;Athrîna, Nadinta-bel, Khshatrita, Vahyazdâta, Arakha, and
Chitrantakhma; an inscription, written in the three official languages
of the court, recounts at full length his mighty deeds. The drama did
not, however, come to a close with the punishment of Vahyazdâta, for
though no tribe or chieftain remained now in open revolt, many of those
who had taken no active share in the rebellion had, by their conduct
during the crisis, laid themselves open to grave suspicions, and it
seemed but prudent to place them under strict surveillance or to remove
them from office altogether. Orotes had been summarily despatched, and
his execution did not disturb the peace of Asia Minor; but Aryandes, to
whose rule Cambyses had entrusted the valley of the Nile, displayed no
less marked symptoms of disaffection, and deserved the same fate. Though
he had not ventured to usurp openly the title of king, he had arrogated
to himself all the functions and rights of royalty, and had manifested
as great an independence in his government as if he had been an actual
Pharaoh. The inhabitants of Gyrene did not approve of the eagerness
displayed by their tyrant Arkesilas III. to place himself under the
Persian yoke: after first expelling and then recalling him, they drove
him away a second time, and at length murdered him at Barca, whither
he had fled for refuge. Pheretimô came to Egypt to seek the help of
Aryandes, just as Laarchos had formerly implored the assistance of
Amasis, and represented to him that her son had fallen a victim to his
devotion to his suzerain. It was a good opportunity to put to ransom
one of the wealthiest countries of Africa; so the governor sent to the
Cyrenaica all the men and vessels at his disposal. Barca was the only
city to offer any resistance, and the Persian troops were detained
for nine months motionless before its walls, and the city then only
succumbed through treachery. Some detachments forced their way as far
as the distant town of Euesperides,* and it is possible that Aryandes
dreamt for a moment of realising the designs which Cambyses had formed
against Carthage. Insufficiency of supplies stayed the advance of his
generals; but the riches of their ally, Cyrene, offered them a strong
temptation, and they were deliberating how they might make this wealth
their own before returning to Memphis, and were, perhaps, on the point
of risking the attempt, when they received orders to withdraw. The march
across the desert proved almost fatal to them. The Libyans of Marmarica,
attracted by the spoils with which the Persian troops were laden,
harassed them incessantly, and inflicted on them serious losses; they
succeeded, however, in arriving safely with their prisoners, among whom
were the survivors of the inhabitants of Barca. At this time the tide of
fortune was setting strongly in favour of Darius: Aryandes, anxious to
propitiate that monarch, despatched these wretched captives to Persia as
a trophy of his success, and Darius sent them into Bactriana, where they
founded a new Barca.**
</p>
<pre>
     * This is the town which later on under the Lagidæ received
     the name of Berenice, and which is now called Benghazi.

     ** It is doubtless to these acts of personal authority on
     the part of Aryandes that Darius alludes in the Behistun
     Inscription, when he says, "While I was before Babylon, the
     following provinces revolted against me&mdash;Persia and Susiana,
     the Medes and Assyria, and the Egyptians..."
</pre>
<p>
But this tardy homage availed him nothing. Darius himself visited Egypt
and disembarrassed himself of 'his troublesome subject by his summary
execution, inflicted, some said, because he had issued coins of a
superior fineness to those of the royal mint,* while, according to
others, it was because he had plundered Egypt and so ill-treated the
Egyptians as to incite them to rebellion.
</p>
<pre>
     * It is not certain that Aryandes did actually strike any
     coinage in his own name, and perhaps Herodotus has only
     repeated a popular story current in Egypt in his days. If
     this money actually existed, its coinage was but a pretext
     employed by Darius; the true motive of the condemnation of
     Aryandes was certainly an armed revolt, or a serious
     presumption of revolutionary intentions.
</pre>
<p>
After the suppression of this rival, Darius set himself to win the
affection of his Egyptian province, or, at least, to render its
servitude bearable. With a country so devout and so impressed with its
own superiority over all other nations, the best means of accomplishing
his object was to show profound respect for its national gods and
its past glory. Darius, therefore, proceeded to shower favours on the
priests, who had been subject to persecution ever since the disastrous
campaign in Ethiopia. Cambyses had sent into exile in Elam the chief
priest of Sais&mdash;that Uza-harrîsnîti who had initiated him into the
sacred rites; Darius gave permission to this important personage to
return to his native land, and commissioned him to repair the damage
inflicted by the madness of the son of Cyrus. Uzaharrîsnîti, escorted
back with honour to his native city, re-established there the colleges
of sacred scribes, and restored to the temple of Nît the lands and
revenues which had been confiscated. Greek tradition soon improved upon
the national account of this episode, and asserted that Darius took an
interest in the mysteries of Egyptian theology, and studied the sacred
books, and that on his arrival at Memphis in 517 B.C., immediately after
the death of an Apis, he took part publicly in the general mourning,
and promised a reward of a hundred talents of gold to whosoever should
discover the successor of the bull. According to a popular story still
current when Herodotus travelled in Egypt, the king visited the temple
of Pthah before leaving Memphis, and ordered his statue to be erected
there beside that of Sesostris. The priests refused to obey this
command, for, said they, "Darius has not equalled the deeds of
Sesostris: he has not conquered the Scythians, whom Sesostris overcame."
Darius replied that "he hoped to accomplish as much as Sesostris
had done, if he lived as long as Sesostris," and so conciliated
the patriotic pride of the priests. The Egyptians, grateful for his
moderation, numbered him among the legislators whose memory they
revered, by the side of Menés, Asykhis, Bocchoris, and Sabaco.
</p>
<p>
The whole empire was now obedient to the will of one man, but the ordeal
from which it had recently escaped showed how loosely the elements of it
were bound together, and with what facility they could be disintegrated.
The system of government in force hitherto was that introduced
into Assyria by Tiglath-pileser III., which had proved so eminently
successful in the time of Sargon and his descendants; Babylon and
Ecbatana had inherited it from Nineveh, and Persepolis had in turn
adopted it from Ecbatana and Babylon. It had always been open to
objections, of which by no means the least was the great amount of power
and independence accorded by it to the provincial governors; but this
inconvenience had been little felt when the empire was of moderate
dimensions, and when no province permanently annexed to the empire lay
at any very great distance from the capital for the time being. But this
was no longer the case, now that Persian rule extended over nearly the
whole of Asia, from the Indus to the Thracian Bosphorus, and over a
portion of Africa also. It must have seemed far from prudent to set
governors invested with almost regal powers over countries so distant
that a decree despatched from the palace might take several weeks
to reach its destination. The heterogeneity of the elements in each
province was a guarantee of peace in the eyes of the sovereign, and
Darius carefully abstained from any attempt at unification: not only did
he allow vassal republics, and tributary kingdoms and nations to subsist
side by side, but he took care that each should preserve its own local
dynasty, language, writing, customs, religion, and peculiar legislation,
besides the right to coin money stamped with the name of its chief or
its civic symbol. The Greek cities of the coast maintained their own
peculiar constitutions which they had enjoyed under the Mernmadas;
Darius merely required that the chief authority among them should rest
in the hands of the aristocratic party, or in those of an elective or
hereditary tyrant whose personal interest secured his fidelity. The
Carians,* Lycians,** Pamphylians, and Cilicians*** continued under the
rule of their native princes, subject only to the usual obligations.
of the <i>corvée</i>, taxation, and military service as in past days; the
majority of the barbarous tribes which inhabited the Taurus and the
mountainous regions in the centre of Asia Minor were even exempted from
all definite taxes, and were merely required to respect the couriers,
caravans, and armies which passed through their territory.

Native magistrates and kings still bore sway in Phoenicia* and Cyprus,
and the shêkhs of the desert preserved their authority over the
marauding and semi-nomadic tribes of Idumasa, Nabatsea, Moab, and Ammon,
and the wandering Bedâwin on the Euphrates and the Khabur. Egypt,
under Darius, remained what she had been under the Saitic and Ethiopian
dynasties, a feudal state governed by a Pharaoh, who, though a
foreigner, was yet reputed to be of the solar race; the land continued
to be divided unequally into diverse principalities, Thebes still
preserving its character as a theocracy under the guidance of the
pallacide of Amon and her priestly counsellors, while the other
districts subsisted under military chieftains. Our information
concerning the organisation of the central and eastern provinces is
incomplete, but it is certain that here also the same system prevailed.
In the years of peace which succeeded the troubled opening of his reign,
that is, from 519 to 515 B.C.,** Darius divided the whole empire into
satrapies, whose number varied at different periods of his reign from
twenty to twenty-three, and even twenty-eight.***
</p>
<pre>
     * Three kings, viz. the kings of Sidon, Tyre, and Arvad,
     bore commands in the Phoenician fleet of Xerxes.

     ** Herodotus states that this dividing of the empire into
     provinces took place immediately after the accession of
     Darius, and this mistake is explained by the fact that he
     ignores almost entirely the civil wars which filled the
     earliest years of the reign. His enumeration of twenty
     satrapies comprises India and omits Thrace, which enables us
     to refer the drawing up of his list to a period before the
     Scythian campaign, viz. before 514 B.C. Herodotus very
     probably copied it from the work of Hecatseus of Miletus,
     and consequently it reproduces a document contemporary with
     Darius himself.

     *** The number twenty is, as has been remarked, that given
     by Herodotus, and probably by Hecatæus of Miletus. The great
     Behistun Inscription enumerates twenty-three countries, and
     the Inscription of Nakhsh-î-Rustem gives twenty-eight.
</pre>
<p>
Persia proper was not included among these, for she had been the cradle
of the reigning house, and the instrument of conquest.*
</p>
<pre>
     * In the great Behistun Inscription Darius mentions Persia
     first of all the countries in his possession. In the
     Inscription E of Persepolis he omits it entirely, and in
     that of Nakhsh-î-Rustem he does not include it in the
     general catalogue.
</pre>
<p>
The Iranian table-land, and the parts of India or regions
beyond the Oxus which bordered on it, formed twelve important
vice-royalties&mdash;Media, Hyrcania, Parthia, Zaranka, Aria, Khorasmia,
Bactriana, Sogdiana, Gandaria, and the country of the Sakae&mdash;reaching
from the plains of Tartary almost to the borders of China, the country
of the Thatagus in the upper basin of the Elmend, Arachosia, and the
land of Maka on the shores of the Indian Ocean. Ten satrapies were
reckoned in the west&mdash;Uvayâ, Elam, in which lay Susa, one of the
favourite residences of Darius; Babirus (Babylon) and Chaldæa; Athurâ,
the ancient kingdom of Assyria; Arabayâ, stretching from the Khabur to
the Litany, the Jordan, and the Orontes; Egypt, the peoples of the sea,
among whom were reckoned the Phoenicians, Cilicians, and Cypriots, and
the islanders of the Ægean; Yaunâ, which comprised Lycia, Caria, and the
Greek colonies along the coast; Sparda, with Phrygia and Mysia; Armenia;
and lastly, Katpatuka or Cappadocia, which lay on both sides of the
Halys from the Taurus to the Black Sea. If each of these provinces had
been governed, as formerly, by a single individual, who thus became king
in all but name and descent, the empire would have run great risk of a
speedy dissolution. Darius therefore avoided concentrating the civil and
military powers in the same hands. In each province he installed three
officials independent of each other, but each in direct communication
with himself&mdash;a satrap, a general, and a secretary of state. The satraps
were chosen from any class in the nation, from among the poor as well as
from among the wealthy, from foreigners as well as from Persians;* but
the most important satrapies were bestowed only on persons allied by
birth** or marriage with the Achæmenids,*** and, by preference, on the
legitimate descendants of the six noble houses. They were not appointed
for any prescribed period, but continued in office during the king's
pleasure. They exercised absolute authority in all civil matters, and
maintained a court, a body-guard,**** palaces and extensive parks, or
<i>paradises</i>, where they indulged in the pleasures of the chase; they
controlled the incidence of taxation,^ administered justice, and
possessed the power of life and death.
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus mentions a satrap chosen from among the Lydians,
     Pactyas, and another satrap of Greek extraction, Xenagoras
     of Halicarnassus.

     ** The most characteristic instance is that of Hystaspes,
     who was satrap of Persia under Oambyses, and of Parthia and
     Hyrcania under his own son. One of the brothers of Darius,
     Artaphernes, was satrap of Sardes, and three of the king's
     sons, Achemenes, Ariabignes, and Masistes, were satraps of
     Egypt, Ionia, and Bactriana respectively.

     *** To understand how well established was the custom of
     bestowing satrapies on those only who were allied by
     marriage to the royal house, it is sufficient to recall the
     fact that, later on, under Xerxes I., when Pausanias, King
     of Sparta, had thoughts of obtaining the position of satrap
     in Greece, he asked for the hand of an Achæmenian princess.

     **** We know, for example, that Orcotes, satrap of Sardes
     under Cyrus, Cambyses, and Darius, had a body-guard of 1000
     Persians.

     ^ Thus, Artaphernes, satrap of Sardes, had a cadastral
     survey made of the territory of the Ionians, and by the
     results of this survey he regulated the imposition of taxes,
     "which from that time up to the present day are exacted
     according to his ordinance."
</pre>
<p>
Attached to each satrap was a secretary of state, who ostensibly acted
as his chancellor, but whose real function was to exercise a secret
supervision over his conduct and report upon it to the imperial
ministers.* The Persian troops, native militia and auxiliary forces
quartered in the province, were placed under the orders, moreover, of
a general, who was usually hostile to the satrap and the secretary.**
These three officials counterbalanced each other, and held each other
mutually in check, so that a revolt was rendered very difficult, if not
impossible. All three were kept in constant communication with the
court by relays of regular couriers, who carried their despatches on
horseback or on camels, from one end of Asia to the other, in the space
of a few weeks.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The rôle played by the secretary is clearly indicated by
     the history of Orotes, satrap of Sardes.

     ** While Darius appoints his brother Artaphernes satrap of
     Lydia, he entrusts the command of the army and the fleet to
     Otanes, son of Sisamnes. Similarly several generals are met
     with at the side of Artaphernes in the Ionic revolt.

     *** Xenophon compares their speed in travelling to the
     flight of birds. A good example of the use of the camel for
     the postal service is cited by Strabo, on the occasion of
     the death of Philotas and the execution of Parmenion under
     Alexander.
</pre>
<p>
The most celebrated of the post-roads was that which ran from Sardes
to Susa through Lydia and Phrygia, crossing the Halys, traversing
Cappadocia and Cilicia, and passing through Armenia and across the
Euphrates, until at length, after passing through Matiênê and the
country of the Cossæans, it reached Elam. This main route was divided
into one hundred and eleven stages, which were performed by couriers on
horseback and partly in ferry-boats, in eighty-four days. Other routes,
of which we have no particular information, led to Egypt, Media,
Bactria, and India,* and by their means the imperial officials in the
capital were kept fully informed of all that took place in the most
distant parts of the empire. As an extra precaution, the king sent
out annually certain officers, called his "eyes" or his "ears,"** who
appeared on the scene when they were least expected, and investigated
the financial or political situation, reformed abuses in the
administration, and reprimanded or even suspended the government
officials; they were accompanied by a body of troops to support their
decisions, whose presence invested their counsels with the strongest
sanction.*** An unfavourable report, a slight irregularity, a mere
suspicion, even, was sufficient to disqualify a satrap. Sometimes he
was deposed, often secretly condemned to death without a trial, and the
execution of the judgment was committed even to his own servants.
</p>
<pre>
     * Ctesias at the end of his work describes the route leading
     from Ephesus to Bactriana and India. It is probable that the
     route described by Isidorus of Charax in his <i>Stathma
     Parthica</i> already existed in the times of the Achæmenids,
     and was traversed by their postal couriers.

     ** Mention of the <i>Eye of the king</i> occurs in Herodotus, in
     Æschylus, and in Plutarch, of the <i>Ear</i> in Xenophon; cf.
     the Persian proverb, according to which "The king has many
     eyes and many ears."

     *** Xenophon affirms that these inspections were still held
     in his day.

This reform in the method of government was displeasing to the Persian
nobles, whose liberty of action it was designed to curtail, and they
took their revenge in sneering at the obedience they could not refuse
to render. Cyrus, they said, had been a father, Cambyses a master,
but Darius was only a pedler greedy of gain. The chief reason for this
division of the empire into provinces was, indeed, fiscal rather than
political: to arrange the incidence of taxation in his province, to
collect the revenue in due time and forward the total amount to the
imperial treasury, formed the fundamental duty of a satrap, to which all
others had to yield. Persia proper was exempt from the payment of any
fixed sum, its inhabitants being merely required to offer presents
to the king whenever he passed through their districts. These
semi-compulsory gifts were proportioned to the fortunes of the
individual contributors; they might consist merely of an ox or a
sheep, a little milk or cheese, some dates, a handful of flour, or some
vegetables. The other provinces, after being subjected to a careful
survey, were assessed partly in money, partly in kind, according to
their natural capacity or wealth. The smallest amount of revenue
raised in any province amounted to 170 talents of silver&mdash;the sum, for
instance, collected from Arachosia with its dependencies Gedrosia and
Grandara; while Egypt yielded a revenue of 700 talents, and the amount
furnished by Babylon, the wealthiest province of all, amounted to
1000 talents. The total revenue of the empire reached the enormous sum
of.£3,311,997, estimated by weight of silver, which is equivalent to
over £26,000,000 of modern English money, if the greater value of silver
in antiquity is taken into consideration. In order to facilitate the
collection of the revenue, Darius issued the gold and silver coins which
are named after him. On the obverse side these darics are stamped with a
figure of the sovereign, armed with the bow or javelin. They were coined
on the scale of 3000 gold darics to one talent, each daric weighing
normally.2788 oz. troy, and being worth exactly 20 silver drachmae
or Medic shekels; so that the relative value of the two metals was
approximately 1 to 13 1/2|.
</p>


<p>
The most ancient type of daric was thick and irregular in shape, and
rudely stamped, but of remarkable fineness, the amount of alloy being
never more than three per cent. The use of this coinage was nowhere
obligatory, and it only became general in the countries bordering on the
Mediterranean, where it met the requirements of international traffic
and political relations, and in the payment of the army and the navy.
In the interior, the medium of exchange used in wholesale and retail
commercial transactions continued to be metals estimated by weight, and
the kings of Persia themselves preferred to store their revenues in the
shape of bullion; as the metal was received at the royal treasury it
was melted and poured into clay moulds, and was minted into money only
gradually, according to the whim or necessity of the moment.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Arrian relates that Alexander found 50,000 talents' weight
     of silver in the treasury at Susa; other hoards quite as
     rich were contained in the palaces of Persepolis and
     Pasargadæ.
</pre>
<p>
Taxes in kind were levied even more largely than in money, but the exact
form they assumed in the different regions of the empire has not yet
been ascertained. The whole empire was divided into districts, which
were charged with the victualling of the army and the court, and Babylon
alone bore a third of the charges under this head. We learn elsewhere
that Egypt was bound to furnish corn for the 120,000 men of the army
of occupation, and that the fisheries of the Fayum yielded the king a
yearly revenue of 240 talents. The Medes furnished similarly 100,000
sheep, 4000 mules, and 3000 horses; the Armenians, 30,000 foals;
the Cilicians, 365 white horses, one for each day in the year; the
Babylonians, 500 youthful eunuchs; and any city or town which produced
or manufactured any valuable commodity was bound to furnish a regular
supply to the sovereign. Thus, Chalybon provided wine; Libya and the
Oases, salt; India, dogs, with whose support four large villages in
Babylonia were charged; the Æolian Assos, cheese; and other places, in
like manner, wool, wines, dyes, medicines, and chemicals. These imperial
taxes, though they seem to us somewhat heavy, were not excessive, but
taken by themselves they give us no idea of the burdens which each
province had to resign itself to bear. The state provided no income for
the satraps; their maintenance and that of their suite were charged on
the province, and they made ample exactions on the natives. The province
of Babylon was required to furnish its satrap daily with an <i>ardeb</i> of
silver; Egypt, India, Media, and Syria each provided a no less generous
allowance for its governor, and the poorest provinces were not less
heavily burdened. The satraps required almost as much to satisfy their
requirements as did the king; but for the most part they fairly earned
their income, and saved more to their subjects than they extorted
from them. They repressed brigandage, piracy, competition between the
various cities, and local wars; while quarrels, which formerly would
have been settled by an appeal to arms, were now composed before their
judgment-seats, and in case of need the rival factions were forcibly
compelled to submit to their decisions. They kept up the roads,
and afforded complete security to travellers by night and day; they
protected industries and agriculture, and, in accordance with the
precepts of their religious code, they accounted it an honourable task
to break up waste land or replant deserted sites. Darius himself did
not disdain to send congratulations to a satrap who had planted trees
in Asia Minor, and laid out one of those wooded parks in which the king
delighted to refresh himself after the fatigues of government, by the
exercise of walking or in the pleasures of the chase. In spite of its
defects, the system of government inaugurated by Darius secured real
prosperity to his subjects, and to himself a power far greater than that
enjoyed by any of his predecessors. It rendered revolts on the part of
the provincial governors extremely difficult, and enabled the court to
draw up a regular budget and provide for its expenses without any undue
pressure on its subjects; in one point only was it defective, but that
point was a cardinal one, namely, in the military organisation. Darius
himself maintained, for his personal protection, a bodyguard recruited
from the Persians and the Medes. It was divided into three corps,
consisting respectively of 2000 cavalry, 2000 infantry of noble birth,
armed with lances whose shafts were ornamented below with apples of gold
or silver&mdash;whence their name of <i>mêlophori</i>&mdash;and under them the 10,000
"immortals," in ten battalions, the first of which had its lances
ornamented with golden pomegranates. This guard formed the nucleus of
the standing army, which could be reinforced by the first and second
grades of Persian and Median feudal nobility at the first summons.
Forces of varying strength garrisoned the most important fortresses of
the empire, such as Sardes, Memphis, Elephantine, Daphnæ, Babylon, and
many others, to hold the restless natives in check. These were, indeed,
the only regular troops on which the king could always rely. Whenever
a war broke out which demanded no special effort, the satraps of the
provinces directly involved summoned the military contingents of the
cities and vassal states under their control, and by concerted action
endeavoured to bring the affair to a successful issue without the
necessity of an appeal to the central authority. If, on the contrary,
troubles arose which threatened the welfare of the whole empire, and the
sovereign felt called upon to conduct the campaign in person, he would
mobilise his guard, and summon the reserves from several provinces or
even from all of them. Veritable hordes of recruits then poured in, but
these masses of troops, differing from each other in their equipment and
methods of fighting, in disposition and in language, formed a herd
of men rather than an army. They had no cohesion or confidence in
themselves, and their leaders, unaccustomed to command such enormous
numbers, suffered themselves to be led rather than exercise authority
as guides. Any good qualities the troops may have possessed were
neutralised by lack of unity in their methods of action, and their
actual faults exaggerated this defect, so that, in spite of their
splendid powers of endurance and their courage under every ordeal, they
ran the risk of finding themselves in a state of hopeless inferiority
when called upon to meet armies very much smaller, but composed of
homogenous elements, all animated with the same spirit and drilled in
the same school.

By continual conquests, the Persians were now reduced to only two
outlets for their energies, in two opposite directions&mdash;in the east
towards India, in the west towards Greece. Everywhere else their advance
was arrested by the sea or other obstacles almost as impassable to their
heavily armed battalions: to the north the empire was bounded by the
Black Sea, the Caucasus, the Caspian Sea, and the Siberian steppes; to
the south, by the Indian Ocean, the sandy table-land of Arabia, and the
African deserts. At one moment, about 512 B.C., it is possible that they
pushed forward towards the east.*
</p>
<pre>
     * India is not referred to in the Behistun Inscription, but
     is mentioned in one of the Inscriptions of Persepolis, and
     in that of Nakhsh-î-Rustem. The campaign in which it was
     subjugated must be placed about 512 B.C.

From the Iranian plateau they beheld from afar the immense plain of the
Hapta Hindu (or the Punjab). Darius invaded this territory, and made
himself master of extensive districts which he formed into a new
satrapy, that of India, but subsequently, renouncing all idea of
pushing eastward as far as the Granges, he turned his steps towards the
southeast. A fleet, constructed at Peukêla and placed under the command
of a Greek admiral, Scylax of Caryanda, descended the Indus by order
of the king;* subjugating the tribes who dwelt along the banks as he
advanced, Scylax at length reached the ocean, on which he ventured
forth, undismayed by the tides, and proceeded in a westerly direction,
exploring, in less than thirty months, the shores of Gedrosia and
Arabia.
</p>
<pre>
     * Scylax published an account of his voyage which was still
     extant in the time of Aristotle. Hugo Berger questions the
     authenticity of the circumnavigation of Arabia, as that of
     the circumnavigation of Africa under Necho.
</pre>
<p>
Once on the threshold of India, the Persians saw open before them a
brilliant and lucrative career: the circumstances which prevented them
from following up this preliminary success are unknown&mdash;perhaps the
first developments of nascent Buddhism deterred them&mdash;but certain it
is that they arrested their steps when they had touched merely the
outskirts of the basin of the Indus, and retreated at once towards the
west. The conquest of Lydia, and subsequently of the Greek cities and
islands along the coast of the Ægean, had doubtless enriched the empire
by the acquisition of active subject populations, whose extraordinary
aptitude in the arts of peace as well as of war might offer incalculable
resources to a sovereign who should know how to render them tractable
and rule them wisely. Not only did they possess the elements of a navy
as enterprising and efficacious as that of the Phoenicians, but the
perfection of their equipment and their discipline on land rendered them
always superior to any Asiatic army, in whatever circumstances, unless
they were crushed by overwhelming numbers. Inquisitive, bold, and
restless, greedy of gain, and inured to the fatigues and dangers of
travel, the Greeks were to be encountered everywhere&mdash;in Asia Minor,
Egypt, Syria, Babylon, and even Persia itself; and it was a Greek, we
must remember, whom the great king commissioned to navigate the course
of the Indus and the waters of the Indian Ocean. At the same time, the
very ardour of their temperament, and their consequent pride, their
impatience of all regular control, their habitual proneness to
civic strife, and to sanguinary quarrels with the inhabitants of
the neighbouring cities, rendered them the most dangerous subjects
imaginable to govern, and their loyalty very uncertain. Moreover,
their admission as vassals of the Persian empire had not altered their
relations with European Greece, and commercial transactions between the
opposite shores of the Ægean, inter-marriages, the travels of voyagers,
movements of mercenaries, and political combinations, went on as freely
and frequently under the satraps of Sardes as under the Mermnadas. It
was to Corinth, Sparta, and Athens that the families banished by Cyrus
after his conquest fled for refuge, and every time a change of party
raised a new tyrant to power in one of the Æolian, Ionian, or Doric
communities, the adherents of the deposed ruler rushed in similar manner
to seek shelter among their friends across the sea, sure to repay their
hospitality should occasion ever require it. Plots and counterplots were
formed between the two shores, without any one paying much heed to the
imperial authority of Persia, and the constant support which the subject
Greeks found among their free brethren was bound before long to rouse
the anger of the court at Susa. When Polycrates, foreseeing the fall of
Amasis, placed himself under the suzerainty of Cambyses, the Corinthians
and Spartans came to besiege him in Samos without manifesting any
respect for the great king. They failed in this particular enterprise,*
but later on, after Oroetes had been seized and put to death, it was to
the Spartans that the successor of Polycrates, Maaandrios, applied
for help to assert his claim to the possession of the tyranny against
Syloson, brother of Polycrates and a personal friend of Darius.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The date of the death of Polycrates must be placed between
     that of the conquest of Egypt and that of the revolt of
     Gaumâta, either in 524 or 523 B.C.

     ** The reinstatement of Syloson may be placed in 516 B.C.,
     about the time when Darius was completing the reorganisation
     of the empire and preparing to attack Greece.
</pre>
<p>
This constant intervention of the foreigner was in evident contradiction
to the spirit which had inspired the reorganisation of the empire. Just
when efforts were being made to strengthen the imperial power and ensure
more effective obedience from the provincials by the institution of
satrapies, it was impossible to put up with acts of unwarrantable
interference, which would endanger the prestige of the sovereign and the
authority of his officers. Conquest presented the one and only natural
means of escape from the difficulties of the present situation and of
preventing their recurrence; when satraps should rule over the European
as well as over the Asiatic coasts of the Ægean, all these turbulent
Greeks would be forced to live at peace with one another and in awe of
the sovereign, as far as their fickle nature would allow. It was not
then, as is still asserted, the mere caprice of a despot which brought
upon the Greek world the scourge of the Persian wars, but the imperious
necessity of security, which obliges well-organised empires to subjugate
in turn all the tribes and cities which cause constant trouble on its
frontiers. Darius, who was already ruler of a good third of the Hellenic
world, from Trebizond to Barca, saw no other means of keeping what he
already possessed, and of putting a stop to the incessant fomentation of
rebellion in his own territories, than to conquer the mother-country as
he had conquered the colonies, and to reduce to subjection the whole of
European Hellas.
