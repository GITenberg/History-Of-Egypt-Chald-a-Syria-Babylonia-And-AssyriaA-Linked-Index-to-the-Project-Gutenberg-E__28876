<h2>
    CHAPTER II&mdash;THE MEMPHITE EMPIRE
</h2>
<p>
<i>The royal pyramid builders: Kheops, Khephren, Mykerinos&mdash;Memphite
literature and art&mdash;Extension of Egypt towards the South, and the
conquest of Nubia by the Pharaohs.</i>
</p>
<p>
At that time "the Majesty of King Huni died, and the Majesty of King
Snofrûi arose to be a sovereign benefactor over this whole earth." All
that we know of him is contained in one sentence: he fought against the
nomads of Sinai, constructed fortresses to protect the eastern frontier
of the Delta, and made for himself a tomb in the form of a pyramid.
</p>
<p>
The almost uninhabited country which connects Africa with Asia is
flanked towards the south by two chains of hills which unite at right
angles, and together form the so-called Gebel et-Tîh. This country is
a tableland, gently inclined from south to north, bare, sombre, covered
with flint-shingle, and siliceous rocks, and breaking out at frequent
intervals into long low chalky hills, seamed with wadys, the largest
of which&mdash;that of El-Arish&mdash;having drained all the others into itself,
opens into the Mediterranean halfway between Pelusiam and Gaza. Torrents
of rain are not infrequent in winter and spring, but the small quantity
of water which they furnish is quickly evaporated, and barely keeps
alive the meagre vegetation in the bottom of the valleys. Sometimes,
after months of absolute drought, a tempest breaks over the more
elevated parts of the desert.*
</p>
<pre>
     * In chap. viii. of the <i>Account of the Survey</i>, pp. 226-
     228, Mr. Holland describes a sudden rainstorm or "sell" on
     December 3, 1867, which drowned thirty persons, destroyed
     droves of camels and asses, flocks of sheep and goats, and
     swept away, in the Wady Feîrân, a thousand palm trees and a
     grove of tamarisks, two miles in length. Towards 4.30 in the
     afternoon, a few drops of rain began to fall, but the storm
     did not break till 5 p.m. At 5.15 it was at its height, and
     it was not over till 9.30. The torrent, which at 8 p.m. was
     10 feet deep, and was about 1000 feet in width, was, at 6
     a.m. the next day, reduced to a small streamlet.
</pre>
<p>
The wind rises suddenly in squall-like blasts; thick clouds, borne one
knows not whence, are riven by lightning to the incessant accompaniment
of thunder; it would seem as if the heavens had broken up and were
crashing down upon the mountains. In a few moments streams of muddy
water rushing down the ravines, through the gulleys and along the
slightest depressions, hurry to the low grounds, and meeting there in a
foaming concourse, follow the fall of the land; a few minutes later,
and the space between one hillside and the other is occupied by a deep
river, flowing with terrible velocity and irresistible force. At the end
of eight or ten hours the air becomes clear, the wind falls, the rain
ceases; the hastily formed river dwindles, and for lack of supply is
exhausted; the inundation comes to an end almost as quickly as it began.
In a short time nothing remains of it but some shallow pools scattered
in the hollows, or here and there small streamlets which rapidly dry up.
The flood, however, accelerated by its acquired velocity, continues to
descend towards the sea. The devastated flanks of the hills, their
torn and corroded bases, the accumulated masses of shingle left by
the eddies, the long lines of rocks and sand, mark its route and bear
evidence everywhere of its power. The inhabitants, taught by experience,
avoid a sojourn in places where tempests have once occurred. It is in
vain that the sky is serene above them and the sun shines overhead; they
always fear that at the moment in which danger seems least likely to
threaten them, the torrent, taking its origin some twenty leagues off,
may be on its headlong way to surprise them. And, indeed, it comes so
suddenly and so violently that nothing in its course can escape it:
men and beasts, before there is time to fly, often even before they
are aware of its approach, are swept away and pitilessly destroyed. The
Egyptians applied to the entire country the characteristic epithet of
To-Shûît, the land of Emptiness, the land of Aridity.
</p>
<a name="image-0008"><!--IMG--></a>

</center>

<p>
They divided it into various districts&mdash;the upper and lower Tonû, Aia,
Kadûma. They called its inhabitants Hirû-Shâîtû, the lords of the Sands;
Nomiû-Shâîtû, the rovers of the Sands; and they associated them with the
Amu&mdash;that is to say, with a race which we recognize as Semitic. The type
of these barbarians, indeed, reminds one of the Semitic massive
head, aquiline nose, retreating forehead, long beard, thick and not
infrequently crisp hair. They went barefoot, and the monuments represent
them as girt with a short kilt, though they also wore the <i>abayah</i>.
Their arms were those commonly used by the Egyptians&mdash;the bow, lance,
club, knife, battle-axe, and shield. They possessed great flocks of
goats or sheep, but the horse and camel were unknown to them, as well as
to their African neighbours. They lived chiefly upon the milk of their
flocks, and the fruit of the date-palm. A section of them tilled the
soil: settled around springs or wells, they managed by industrious
labour to cultivate moderately sized but fertile fields, flourishing
orchards, groups of palms, fig and olive trees, and vines. In spite of
all this their resources were insufficient, and their position would
have been precarious if they had not been able to supplement their
stock of provisions from Egypt or Southern Syria. They bartered at the
frontier markets their honey, wool, gums, manna, and small quantities
of charcoal, for the products of local manufacture, but especially for
wheat, or the cereals of which they stood in need. The sight of the
riches gathered together in the eastern plain, from Tanis to Bubastis,
excited their pillaging instincts, and awoke in them an irrepressible
covetousness. The Egyptian annals make mention of their incursions at
the very commencement of history, and they maintained that even the gods
had to take steps to protect themselves from them. The Gulf of Suez and
the mountainous rampart of Gebel Geneffeh in the south, and the marshes
of Pelusium on the north, protected almost completely the eastern
boundary of the Delta; but the Wady Tumilât laid open the heart of the
country to the invaders. The Pharaohs of the divine dynasties in the
first place, and then those of the human dynasties, had fortified this
natural opening, some say by a continuous wall, others by a line of
military posts, flanked on the one side by the waters of the gulf.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The existence of the wall, or of the line of military
     posts, is of very ancient date, for the name Kîm-Oîrît is
     already followed by the hieroglyph of the wall, or by that
     of a fortified enclosure in the texts of the Pyramids.

     and of which this is only the traditional copy.
</pre>
<p>
Snofrûi restored or constructed several castles in this district, which
perpetuated his name for a long time after his death. These had the
square or rectangular form of the towers, whose ruins are still to
be seen on the banks of the Nile. Standing night and day upon the
battlements, the sentinels kept a strict look-out over the desert, ready
to give alarm at the slightest suspicious movement.

<pre>
     Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the vignette by E. H. Palmer,
     <i>The Desert of the Exodus</i>, p. 317.

     The expression Kîm-Oîrît, "the very black," is applied to
     the northern part of the Red Sea, in contradistinction to
     Ûaz-Oîrît, Uazît-Oîrît, "the very green," the
     Mediterranean; a town, probably built at a short distance
     from the village of Maghfâr, had taken its name from the
     gulf on which it was situated, and was also called Kîm-
     Oîrît.
</pre>
<p>
The marauders took advantage of any inequality in the ground to approach
unperceived, and they were often successful in getting through the
lines; they scattered themselves over the country, surprised a village
or two, bore off such women and children as they could lay their hands
on, took possession of herds of animals, and, without carrying their
depredations further, hastened to regain their solitudes before
information of their exploits could have reached the garrison. If their
expeditions became numerous, the general of the Eastern Marches, or the
Pharaoh himself, at the head of a small army, started on a campaign of
reprisals against them. The marauders did not wait to be attacked, but
betook themselves to refuges constructed by them beforehand at certain
points in their territory. They erected here and there, on the crest of
some steep hill, or at the confluence of several wadys, stone towers put
together without mortar, and rounded at the top like so many beehives,
in unequal groups of three, ten, or thirty; here they massed themselves
as well as they could, and defended the position with the greatest
obstinacy, in the hope that their assailants, from the lack of water and
provisions, would soon be forced to retreat.*

     * The members of the English Commission do not hesitate to
     attribute the construction of these towers to the remotest
     antiquity; the Bedouin call them "namûs," plur. "nawamîs,"
     mosquito-houses, and they say that the children of Israel
     built them as a shelter during the night from mosquitos at
     the time of the Exodus. The resemblance of these buildings
     to the "Talayôt" of the Balearic Isles, and to the Scotch
     beehive-shaped houses, has struck all travellers.
</pre>
<p>
Elsewhere they possessed fortified "duars," where not only their
families but also their herds could find a refuge&mdash;circular or oval
enclosures, surrounded by low walls of massive rough stones crowned by a
thick rampart made of branches of acacia interlaced with thorny bushes,
the tents or huts being ranged behind, while in the centre was an empty
space for the cattle. These primitive fortresses were strong enough to
overawe nomads; regular troops made short work of them. The Egyptians
took them by assault, overturned them, cut down the fruit trees, burned
the crops, and retreated in security, after having destroyed everything
in their march. Each of their campaigns, which hardly lasted more than a
few days, secured the tranquillity of the frontier for some years.*

     * The inscription of Uni (11. 22-32) furnishes us with the
     invariable type of the Egyptian campaigns against the Hirû-
     Shâîtû: the bas-reliefs of Karnak might serve to illustrate
     it, as they represent the great raid led by Seti I. into the
     territory of the Shaûsûs and their allies, between the
     frontier of Egypt and the town of Hebron.

<p>
To the south of Gebel et-Tîh, and cut off from it almost completely by a
moat of wadys, a triangular group of mountains known as Sinai thrusts a
wedge-shaped spur into the Red Sea, forcing back its waters to the right
and left into two narrow gulfs, that of Akabah and that of Suez. Gebel
Katherin stands up from the centre and overlooks the whole peninsula. A
sinuous chain detaches itself from it and ends at Gebel Serbâl, at
some distance to the northwest; another trends to the south, and after
attaining in Gebel Umm-Shomer an elevation equal to that of Gebel
Katherin, gradually diminishes in height, and plunges into the sea at
Ras-Mohammed. A complicated system of gorges and valleys&mdash;Wady Nasb,
Wady Kidd, Wady Hebrân, Wady Baba&mdash;furrows the country and holds it as
in a network of unequal meshes. Wady Feîrân contains the most fertile
oasis in the peninsula. A never-failing stream waters it for about two
or three miles of its length; quite a little forest of palms enlivens
both banks&mdash;somewhat meagre and thin, it is true, but intermingled with
acacias, tamarisks, nabecas, carob trees, and willows. Birds sing amid
their branches, sheep wander in the pastures, while the huts of the
inhabitants peep out at intervals from among the trees. Valleys and
plains, even in some places the slopes of the hills, are sparsely
covered with those delicate aromatic herbs which affect a stony soil.
Their life is a perpetual struggle against the sun: scorched, dried up,
to all appearance dead, and so friable that they crumble to pieces in
the fingers when one attempts to gather them, the spring rains annually
infuse into them new life, and bestow upon them, almost before one's
eyes, a green and perfumed youth of some days' duration. The summits of
the hills remain always naked, and no vegetation softens the ruggedness
of their outlines, or the glare of their colouring. The core of the
peninsula is hewn, as it were, out of a block of granite, in which
white, rose-colour, brown, or black predominate, according to the
quantities of felspar, quartz, or oxides of iron which the rocks
contain. Towards the north, the masses of sandstone which join on to
Gebel et-Tîh assume all possible shades of red and grey, from a delicate
lilac neutral tint to dark purple. The tones of colour, although placed
crudely side by side, present nothing jarring nor offensive to the eye;
the sun floods all, and blends them in his light. The Sinaitic peninsula
is at intervals swept, like the desert to the east of Egypt, by terrible
tempests, which denude its mountains and transform its wadys into so
many ephemeral torrents. The Monîtû who frequented this region from the
dawn of history did not differ much from the "Lords of the Sands;" they
were of the same type, had the same costume, the same arms, the same
nomadic instincts, and in districts where the soil permitted it, made
similar brief efforts to cultivate it. They worshipped a god and a
goddess whom the Egyptians identified with Horus and Hâthor; one of
these appeared to represent the light, perhaps the sun, the other the
heavens. They had discovered at an early period in the sides of the
hills rich metalliferous veins, and strata, bearing precious stones;
from these they learned to extract iron, oxides of copper and manganese,
and turquoises, which they exported to the Delta. The fame of their
riches, carried to the banks of the Nile, excited the cupidity of the
Pharaohs; expeditions started from different points of the valley, swept
down upon the peninsula, and established themselves by main force in the
midst of the districts where the mines lay. These were situated to the
north-west, in the region of sandstone, between the western branch
of Gebel et-Tîh and the Gulf of Suez. They were collectively called
Mafkaît, the country of turquoises, a fact which accounts for the
application of the local epithet, lady of Mafkaît, to Hâthor. The
earliest district explored, that which the Egyptians first attacked, was
separated from the coast by a narrow plain and a single range of hills:
the produce of the mines could be thence transported to the sea in a
few hours without difficulty. Pharaoh's labourers called this region the
district of Baîfc, the mine <i>par excellence</i>, or of Bebît, the country
of grottoes, from the numerous tunnels which their predecessors had made
there: the name Wady Maghara, Valley of the Cavern, by which the site
is now designated, is simply an Arabic translation of the old Egyptian
word.
</p>
<p>
The Monîtû did not accept this usurpation of their rights without a
struggle, and the Egyptians who came to work among them had either to
purchase their forbearance by a tribute, or to hold themselves always in
readiness to repulse the assaults of the Monîtû by force of arms. Zosiri
had already taken steps to ensure the safety of the turquoise-seekers
at their work; Snofrûi was not, therefore, the first Pharaoh who passed
that way, but none of his predecessors had left so many traces of his
presence as he did in this out-of-the-way corner of the empire. There
may still be seen, on the north-west slope of the Wady Maghara, the
bas-relief which one of his lieutenants engraved there in memory of a
victory gained over the Monîtû. A Bedouin sheikh fallen on his knees
prays for mercy with suppliant gesture, but Pharaoh has already seized
him by his long hair, and brandishes above his head a white stone mace
to fell him with a single blow.
</p>

<p>
The workmen, partly recruited from the country itself, partly despatched
from the banks of the Nile, dwelt in an entrenched camp upon an isolated
peak at the confluence of Wady Genneh and Wady Maghara. A zigzag pathway
on its smoothest slope ends, about seventeen feet below the summit, at
the extremity of a small and slightly inclined tableland, upon which are
found the ruins of a large village; this is the High Castle&mdash;Hâît-Qaît
of the ancient inscriptions. Two hundred habitations can still be made
out here, some round, some rectangular, constructed of sandstone blocks
without mortar, and not larger than the huts of the fellahîn: in former
times a flat roof of wicker-work and puddled clay extended over each.
The entrance was not so much a door as a narrow opening, through which
a fat man would find it difficult to pass; the interior consisted of
a single chamber, except in the case of the chief of the works, whose
dwelling contained two.

<p>
A rough stone bench from two to two and a half feet high surrounds the
plateau on which the village stands; a <i>cheval défrise</i> made of thorny
brushwood probably completed the defence, as in the <i>duars</i> of the
desert. The position was very strong and easily defended. Watchmen
scattered over the neighbouring summits kept an outlook over the distant
plain and the defiles of the mountains. Whenever the cries of these
sentinels announced the approach of the foe, the workmen immediately
deserted the mine and took refuge in their citadel, which a handful of
resolute men could successfully hold, as long as hunger and thirst did
not enter into the question. As the ordinary springs and wells would
not have been sufficient to supply the needs of the colony, they had
transformed the bottom of the valley into an artificial lake. A dam
thrown across it prevented the escape of the waters, which filled the
reservoir more or less completely according to the season. It never
became empty, and several species of shellfish flourished in it&mdash;among
others, a kind of large mussel which the inhabitants generally used as
food, which with dates, milk, oil, coarse bread, a few vegetables, and
from time to time a fowl or a joint of meat, made up their scanty fare.
Other things were of the same primitive character. The tools found in
the village are all of flint: knives, scrapers, saws, hammers, and heads
of lances and arrows. A few vases brought from Egypt are distinguished
by the fineness of the material and the purity of the design; but the
pottery in common use was made on the spot from coarse clay without
care, and regardless of beauty. As for jewellery, the villagers had
beads of glass or blue enamel, and necklaces of strung cowrie-shells.
In the mines, as in their own houses, the workmen employed stone tools
only, with handles of wood, or of plaited willow twigs, but their
chisels or hammers were more than sufficient to cut the yellow
sandstone, coarse-grained and very friable as it was, in the midst of
which they worked.*
</p>
<pre>
     * E. H. Palmer, however, from his observations, is of
     opinion that the work in the tunnels of the mines was
     executed entirely by means of bronze chisels and tools; the
     flint implements serving only to incise the scenes which
     cover the surfaces of the rocks.
</pre>
<p>
The tunnels running straight into the mountain were low and wide, and
were supported at intervals by pillars of sandstone left <i>in situ</i>.
These tunnels led into chambers of various sizes, whence they followed
the lead of the veins of precious mineral. The turquoise sparkled on
every side&mdash;on the ceiling and on the walls&mdash;and the miners, profiting
by the slightest fissures, cut round it, and then with forcible blows
detached the blocks, and reduced them to small fragments, which they
crushed, and carefully sifted so as not to lose a particle of the gem.
The oxides of copper and of manganese which they met with here and
elsewhere in moderate quantities, were used in the manufacture of those
beautiful blue enamels of various shades which the Egyptians esteemed
so highly. The few hundreds of men of which the permanent population was
composed, provided for the daily exigencies of industry and commerce.
Royal inspectors arrived from time to time to examine into their
condition, to rekindle their zeal, and to collect the product of their
toil. When Pharaoh had need of a greater quantity than usual of minerals
or turquoises, he sent thither one of his officers, with a select body
of carriers, mining experts, and stone-dressers. Sometimes as many
as two or three thousand men poured suddenly into the peninsula, and
remained there one or two months; the work went briskly forward, and
advantage was taken of the occasion to extract and transport to Egypt
beautiful blocks of diorite, serpentine or granite, to be afterwards
manufactured there into sarcophagi or statues. Engraved stelæ, to be
seen on the sides of the mountains, recorded the names of the principal
chiefs, the different bodies of handicraftsmen who had participated in
the campaign, the name of the sovereign who had ordered it and often the
year of his reign.
</p>
<p>
It was not one tomb only which Snofrui had caused to be built, but two.
He called them "Khâ," the Rising, the place where the dead Pharaoh,
identified with the sun, is raised above the world for ever. One of
these was probably situated near Dahshur; the other, the "Khâ rîsi," the
Southern Rising, appears to be identical with the monument of Mêdûm.

The pyramid, like the mastaba,* represents a tumulus with four sides,
in which the earthwork is replaced by a structure of stone or brick. It
indicates the place in which lies a prince, chief, or person of rank in
his tribe or province. It was built on a base of varying area, and was
raised to a greater or less elevation according to the fortune of the
deceased or of his family.**
</p>
<pre>
     * No satisfactory etymon for the word <i>pyramid</i>, has as yet
     been proposed: the least far-fetched is that put forward by
     Cantor-Eisenlohr, according to which <i>pyramid</i> is the Greek
     form, irupauç, of the compound term "piri-m-ûisi," which in
     Egyptian mathematical phraseology designates the <i>salient
     angle</i>, the ridge or height of the pyramid.

     ** The brick pyramids of Abydos were all built for private
     persons. The word "mirit," which designates a pyramid in
     the texts, is elsewhere applied to the tombs of nobles and
     commoners as well as to those of kings.
</pre>
<p>
The fashion of burying in a pyramid was not adopted in the environs of
Memphis until tolerably late times, and the Pharaohs of the primitive
dynasties were interred, as their subjects were, in sepulchral chambers
of mastabas. Zosiri was the only exception, if the step-pyramid of
Saqqâra, as is probable, served for his tomb.*
</p>
<pre>
     * It is difficult to admit that a pyramid of considerable
     dimensions could have disappeared without leaving any traces
     behind, especially when we see the enormous masses of
     masonry which still mark the sites of those which have been
     most injured; besides, the inscriptions connect none of the
     predecessors of Snofrûi with a pyramid, unless it be Zosiri.
     The step-pyramid of Saqqâra, which is attributed to the
     latter, belongs to the same type as that of Mêdûm; so does
     also the pyramid of Rigah, whose occupant is unknown. If we
     admit that this last-mentioned pyramid served as a tomb to
     some intermediate Pharaoh between Zosiri and Snofrûi&mdash;for
     instance, Hûni&mdash;the use of pyramids would be merely
     exceptional for sovereigns anterior to the IVth dynasty.
</pre>
<p>
The motive which determined Snofrûi's choice of Mêdûm as a site, is
unknown to us: perhaps he dwelt in that city of Heracleopolis, which in
course of time frequently became the favourite residence of the kings;
perhaps he improvised for himself a city in the plain between El-Wastah
and Kafr el-Ayat. His pyramid, at the present time, is composed of three
large unequal cubes with slightly inclined sides, arranged in steps one
above the other. Some centuries ago five could be still determined, and
in ancient times, before ruin had set in, as many as seven. Each block
marked a progressive increase of the total mass, and bad its external
face polished&mdash;a fact which we can still determine by examining the
slabs one behind another; a facing of large blocks, of which many of the
courses still exist towards the base, covered the whole, at one angle
from the apex to the foot, and brought it into conformity with the type
of the classic pyramid. The passage had its orifice in the middle of the
north face about sixty feèt above the ground: it is five feet high, and
dips at a tolerably steep angle through the solid masonry. At a depth of
a hundred and ninety-seven feet it becomes level, without increasing
in aperture, runs for forty feet on this plane, traversing two low and
narrow chambers, then making a sharp turn it ascends perpendicularly
until it reaches the floor of the vault. The latter is hewn out of the
mountain rock, and is small, rough, and devoid of ornament: the ceiling
appears to be in three heavy horizontal courses of masonry, which
project one beyond the other corbel-wise, and give the impression of a
sort of acutely pointed arch. Snofrûi slept there for ages; then robbers
found a way to him, despoiled and broke up his mummy, scattered the
fragments of his coffin upon the ground, and carried off the stone
sarcophagus. The apparatus of beams and cords of which they made use for
the descent, hung in their place above the mouth of the shaft until ten
years ago. The rifling of the tomb took place at a remote date, for from
the XXth dynasty onwards the curious were accustomed to penetrate into
the passage: two scribes have scrawled their names in ink on the back
of the framework in which the stone cover was originally inserted.
The sepulchral chapel was built a little in front of the east face; it
consisted of two small-sized rooms with bare surfaces, a court whose
walls abutted on the pyramid, and in the court, facing the door,
a massive table of offerings flanked by two large stelo without
inscriptions, as if the death of the king had put a stop to the
decoration before the period determined on by the architects. It was
still accessible to any one during the XVIIIth dynasty, and people came
there to render homage to the memory of Snofrûi or his wife Mirisônkhû.
Visitors recorded in ink on the walls their enthusiastic, but
stereotyped impressions: they compared the "Castle of Snofrûi" with the
firmament, "when the sun arises in it; the heaven rains incense there
and pours out perfumes on the roof." Ramses II., who had little respect
for the works of his predecessors, demolished a part of the pyramid in
order to procure cheaply the materials necessary for the buildings which
he restored to Heracleopolis. His workmen threw down the waste stone
and mortar beneath the place where they were working, without troubling
themselves as to what might be beneath; the court became choked up,
the sand borne by the wind gradually invaded the chambers, the chapel
disappeared, and remained buried for more than three thousand years.
</p>
<p>
The officers of Snofrûi, his servants, and the people of his city
wished, according to custom, to rest beside him, and thus to form a
court for him in the other world as they had done in this. The menials
were buried in roughly made trenches, frequently in the ground merely,
without coffins or sarcophagi. The body was not laid out its whole
length on its back in the attitude of repose: it more frequently rested
on its left side, the head to the north, the face to the east, the legs
bent, the right arm brought up against the breast, the left following
the outline of the chest and legs.*
</p>
<pre>
     * W. Fl. Petrie, <i>Medum</i>, pp. 21, 22. Many of these mummies
     were mutilated, some lacking a leg, others an arm or a hand;
     these were probably workmen who had fallen victims to an
     accident during the building of the pyramid. In the majority
     of cases the detached limb had been carefully placed with
     the body, doubtless in order that the double might find it
     in the other world, and complete himself when he pleased for
     the exigencies of his new existence.
</pre>
<p>
The people who were interred in a posture so different from that with
which we are familiar in the case of ordinary mummies, belonged to
a foreign race, who had retained in the treatment of their dead the
customs of their native country.

The Pharaohs often peopled their royal cities with prisoners of war,
captured on the field of battle, or picked up in an expedition through
an enemy's country. Snofrûi peopled his city with men from the Libyan
tribes living on the borders of the Western desert or Monîtû captives.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Petrie thinks that the people who were interred in a
     contracted position belonged to the aboriginal race of the
     valley, reduced to a condition of servitude by a race who
     had come from Asia, and who had established the kingdom of
     Egypt. The latter were represented by the mummies disposed
     at full length (<i>Medum</i>, p. 21).

The body having been placed in the grave, the relatives who had taken
part in the mourning heaped together in a neighbouring hole the funerary
furniture, flint implements, copper needles, miniature pots and pans
made of rough and badly burned clay, bread, dates, and eatables in
dishes wrapped up in linen. The nobles ranged their mastabas in a single
line to the north of the pyramid; these form fine-looking masses of
considerable size, but they are for the most part unfinished and empty.
Snofrûi having disappeared from the scene, Kheops who succeeded him
forsook the place, and his courtiers, abandoning their unfinished tombs,
went off to construct for themselves others around that of the new king.
We rarely find at Mêdûm finished and occupied sepulchres except that of
individuals who had died before or shortly after Snofrûi. The mummy of
Eânofir, found in one of them, shows how far the Egyptians had carried
the art of embalming at this period. His body, though much shrunken,
is well preserved: it had been clothed in some fine stuff, then covered
over with a layer of resin, which a clever sculptor had modelled in such
a manner as to present an image resembling the deceased; it was then
rolled in three or four folds of thin and almost transparent gauze.
</p>
<p>
Of these tombs the most important belonged to the Prince Nofirmâît
and his wife Atiti: it is decorated with bas-reliefs of a peculiar
composition; the figures have been cut in outline in the limestone, and
the hollows thus made are filled in with a mosaic of tinted pastes which
show the moulding and colour of the parts. Everywhere else the ordinary
methods of sculpture have been employed, the bas-reliefs being enhanced
by brilliant colouring in a simple and delicate manner.
</p>



<p>
The figures of men and animals are portrayed with a vivacity of manner
which is astonishing; and the other objects, even the hieroglyphs, are
rendered with an accuracy which does not neglect the smallest detail.
The statues of Eâhotpû and of the lady Nofrît, discovered in a
half-ruined mastaba, have fortunately reached us without having suffered
the least damage, almost without losing anything of their original
freshness; they are to be seen in the Gîzeh Museum just as they were
when they left the hands of the workman. Eâhotpû was the son of a king,
perhaps of Snofrûi: but in spite of his high origin, I find something
humble and retiring in his physiognomy. Nofrît, on the contrary, has
an imposing appearance: an indescribable air of resolution and command
invests her whole person, and the sculptor has cleverly given expression
to it. She is represented in a robe with a pointed opening in the front:
the shoulders, the bosom, the waist, and hips, are shown under the
material of the dress with a purity and delicate grace which one does
not always find in more modern works of art. The wig, secured on the
forehead by a richly embroidered band, frames with its somewhat heavy
masses the firm and rather plump face: the eyes are living, the nostrils
breathe, the mouth smiles and is about to speak. The art of Egypt has at
times been as fully inspired; it has never been more so than on the day
in which it produced the statue of Nofrît.
</p>
<p>
The worship of Snofrûi was perpetuated from century to century.
After the fall of the Memphite empire it passed through periods of
intermittence, during which it ceased to be observed, or was observed
only in an irregular way; it reappeared under the Ptolemies for the last
time before becoming extinct for ever. Snofrûi was probably, therefore,
one of the most popular kings of the good old times; but his fame,
however great it may have been among the Egyptians, has been eclipsed in
our eyes by that of the Pharaohs who immediately followed him&mdash;Kheops,
Khephren, and Mykerinos. Not that we are really better acquainted with
their history. All we know of them is made up of two or three series
of facts, always the same, which the contemporaneous monuments teach us
concerning these rulers. Khnûmû-Khûfûi,* abbreviated into Khûfûi, the
Kheops** of the Greeks, was probably the son of Snofrûi.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The existence of the two cartouches Khûfûi and Khnûmû-
     Khûfûi on the same monuments has caused much embarrassment
     to Egyptologists: the majority have been inclined to see
     here two different kings, the second of whom, according to
     M. Robiou, would have been the person who bore the pre-nomen
     of Dadûfri. Khnûmû-Khûfûi signifies "the god Khnûmû protects
     me."

     ** Kheops is the usual form, borrowed from the account of
     Herodotus; Diodorus writes Khembes or Khemmes, Eratosthenes
     Saôphis, and Manetho Souphis.

     *** The story in the "Westcar" papyrus speaks of Snofrûi as
     father of Khûfûi; but this is a title of honour, and proves
     nothing. The few records which we have of this period give
     one, however, the impression that Kheops was the son of
     Snofrûi, and, in spite of the hesitation of de Rougé, this
     affiliation is adopted by the majority of modern historians.

He reigned twenty-three years, and successfully defended the mines of
the Sinaitic peninsula against the Bedouin; he may still be seen on the
face of the rocks in the Wady Maghara sacrificing his Asiatic prisoners,
now before the jackal Anubis, now before the ibis-headed Thot. The gods
reaped advantage from his activity and riches; he restored the temple
of Hâ-thor at Den-dera, embellished that of Bubastis, built a stone
sanctuary to the Isis of the Sphinx, and consecrated there gold, silver,
bronze, and wooden statues of Horus, Nephthys, Selkît, Phtah, Sokhît,
Osiris, Thot, and Hâpis. Scores of other Pharaohs had done as much or
more, on whom no one bestowed a thought a century after their death, and
Kheops would have succumbed to the same indifference had he not forcibly
attracted the continuous attention of posterity by the immensity of his
tomb.*
</p>
<pre>
     * All the details relating to the Isis of the Sphinx are
     furnished by a stele of the daughter of Kheops, discovered
     in the little temple of the XXIst dynasty, situated to the
     west of the Great Pyramid, and preserved in the Gîzeh
     Museum. It was not a work entirely of the XXIst dynasty, as
     Mr. Petrie asserts, but the inscription, barely readable,
     engraved on the face of the plinth, indicates that it was
     remade by a king of the Saïte period, perhaps by Sabaco, in
     order to replace an ancient stele of the same import which
     had fallen into decay.

The Egyptians of the Theban period were compelled to form their opinions
of the Pharaohs of the Memphite dynasties in the same way as we do, less
by the positive evidence of their acts than by the size and number
of their monuments: they measured the magnificence of Kheops by the
dimensions of his pyramid, and all nations having followed this example,
Kheops has continued to be one of the three or four names of former
times which sound familiar to our ears. The hills of Gîzeh in his time
terminated in a bare wind-swept table-land. A few solitary mastabas were
scattered here and there on its surface, similar to those whose ruins
still crown the hill of Dahshur.* The Sphinx, buried even in ancient
times to its shoulders, raised its head half-way down the eastern slope,
at its southern angle;** beside him*** the temple of Osiris, lord of the
Necropolis, was fast disappearing under the sand; and still further back
old abandoned tombs honey-combed the rock.****
</p>
<pre>
     * No one has noticed, I believe, that several of the
     mastabas constructed under Kheops, around the pyramid,
     contain in the masonry fragments of stone belonging to some
     more ancient structures. Those which I saw bore carvings of
     the same style as those on the beautiful mastabas of
     Dahshur.

     ** The stele of the Sphinx bears, on line 13, the cartouche
     of Khephren in the middle of a blank. We have here, I
     believe, an indication of the clearing of the Sphinx
     effected under this prince, consequently an almost certain
     proof that the Sphinx was already buried in sand in the time
     of Kheops and his predecessors.

     *** Mariette identifies the temple which he discovered to
     the south of the Sphinx with that of Osiris, lord of the
     Necropolis, which is mentioned in the inscription of the
     daughter of Kheops. This temple is so placed that it must
     have been sanded up at the same time as the Sphinx; I
     believe, therefore, that the restoration effected by Kheops,
     according to the inscription, was merely a clearing away of
     the sand from the Sphinx analogous to that accomplished by
     Khephren.

     **** These sepulchral chambers are not decorated in the
     majority of instances. The careful scrutiny to which I
     subjected them in 1885-86 causes me to believe that many of
     them must be almost contemporaneous with the Sphinx; that is
     to say, that they had been hollowed out and occupied a
     considerable time before the period of the IVth dynasty.
</pre>

Kheops chose a site for his Pyramid on the northern edge of the plateau,
whence a view of the city of the White Wall, and at the same time of the
holy city of Heliopolis, could be obtained.

     Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Émil Brugsch-Bey. The
     temple of the Sphinx is in the foreground, covered with sand
     up to the top of the walls. The second of the little
     pyramids below the large one is that whose construction is
     attributed to Honîtsonû, the daughter of Kheops, and with
     regard to which the dragomans of the Saite period told such
     strange stories to Herodotus.
</pre>
<p>
A small mound which commanded this prospect was roughly squared, and
incorporated into the masonry; the rest of the site was levelled to
receive the first course of stones. The pyramid when completed had a
height of 476 feet on a base 764 feet square; but the decaying influence
of time has reduced these dimensions to 450 and 730 feet respectively.
It possessed, up to the Arab conquest, its polished facing, coloured
by age, and so subtily jointed that one would have said that it was a
single slab from top to bottom.* The work of facing the pyramid began
at the top; that of the point was first placed in position, then the
courses were successively covered until the bottom was reached.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The blocks which still exist are of white limestone.
     Letronne, after having asserted in his youth (Recherches sur
     Dicuil, p. 107), on the authority of a fragment attributed
     to Philo of Byzantium, that the facing was formed of
     polychromatic zones of granite, of green breccia and other
     different kinds of stone, renounced this view owing to the
     evidence of Vyse. Perrot and Chipiez have revived it, with
     some hesitation.

     ** Herodotus, ii. 125, the word "point" should not be taken
     literally. The Great Pyramid terminated, like its neighbour,
     in a platform, of which each side measured nine English feet
     (six cubits, according to Diodorus Siculus, i. 63), and
     which has become larger in the process of time, especially
     since the destruction of the facing. The summit viewed from
     below must have appeared as a sharp point. "Having regard
     to the size of the monument, a platform of three metres
     square would have been a more pointed extremity than that
     which terminates the obelisks" (Letronne).
</pre>
<p>
In the interior every device had been employed to conceal the exact
position of the sarcophagus, and to discourage the excavators whom
chance or persistent search might have put upon the right track. Their
first difficulty would be to discover the entrance under the limestone
casing. It lay hidden almost in the middle of the northern face, on
the level of the eighteenth course, at about forty-five feet above the
ground. A movable flagstone, working on a stone pivot, disguised it so
effectively that no one except the priests and custodians could have
distinguished this stone from its neighbours. When it was tilted up, a
yawning passage was revealed,* three and a half feet in height, with a
breadth of four feet.
</p>
<pre>
     * Strabo expressly states that in his time the subterranean
     parts of the Great Pyramid were accessible: "It has on its
     side, at a moderate elevation, a stone which can be moved,
     [&mdash;Greek phrase&mdash;]". "When it has been lifted up, a tortuous
     passage is seen which leads to the tomb." The meaning of
     Strabo's statement had not been mastered until Mr. Petrie
     showed, what we may still see, at the entrance of one of the
     pyramids of Dahshur, arrangements which bore witness to the
     existence of a movable stone mounted on a pivot to serve as
     a door. It was a method of closing of the same kind as that
     described by Strabo, perhaps after he had seen it himself,
     or had heard of it from the guides, and like that which Mr.
     Petrie had reinstated, with much probability, at the
     entrance of the Great Pyramid.

The passage is an inclined plane, extending partly through the masonry
and partly through the solid rock for a distance of 318 feet; it passes
through an unfinished chamber and ends in a <i>cul-de-sac</i> 59 feet
further on. The blocks are so nicely adjusted, and the surface so finely
polished, that the joints can be determined only with difficulty. The
corridor which leads to the sepulchral chamber meets the roof at an
angle of 120° to the descending passage, and at a distance of 62 feet
from the entrance. It ascends for 108 feet to a wide landing-place,
where it divides into two branches. One of these penetrates straight
towards the centre, and terminates in a granite chamber with a
high-pitched roof. This is called, but without reason, the "Chamber
of the Queen." The other passage continues to ascend, but its form and
appearance are altered. It now becomes a gallery 148 feet long and some
28 feet high, constructed of beautiful Mokattam stone. The lower courses
are placed perpendicularly one on the top of the other; each of the
upper courses projects above the one beneath, and the last two, which
support the ceiling, are only about 1 foot 8 inches distant from each
other. The small horizontal passage which separates the upper landing
from the sarcophagus chamber itself, presents features imperfectly
explained. It is intersected almost in the middle by a kind of depressed
hall, whose walls are channelled at equal intervals on each side by four
longitudinal grooves. The first of these still supports a fine flagstone
of granite which seems to hang 3 feet 7 inches above the ground, and the
three others were probably intended to receive similar slabs. The latter
is a kind of rectangular granite box, with a flat roof, 19 feet 10
inches high, 1 foot 5 inches deep, and 17 feet broad. No figures or
hieroglyphs are to be seen, but merely a mutilated granite sarcophagus
without a cover. Such were the precautions taken against man: the result
witnessed to their efficacy, for the pyramid preserved its contents
intact for more than four thousand years.* But a more serious danger
threatened them in the great weight of the materials above. In order
to prevent the vault from being crushed under the burden of the hundred
metres of limestone which surmounted it, they arranged above it five
low chambers placed exactly one above the other in order to relieve the
superincumbent stress. The highest of these was protected by a pointed
roof consisting of enormous blocks made to lean against each other at
the top: this ingenious device served to transfer the perpendicular
thrust almost entirely to the lateral faces of the blocks. Although an
earthquake has to some extent dislocated the mass of masonry, not one
of the stones which encase the chamber of the king has been crushed,
not one has yielded by a hair's-breadth, since the day when the workmen
fixed it in its place.
</p>
<pre>
     * Professor Petrie thinks that the pyramids of Gîzeh were
     rifled, and the mummies which they contained destroyed
     during the long civil wars which raged in the interval
     between the VIth and XIIth dynasties. If this be true, it
     will be necessary to admit that the kings of one of the
     subsequent dynasties must have restored what had been
     damaged, for the workmen of the Caliph Al-Mamoun brought
     from the sepulchral chamber of the "Horizon" "a stone
     trough, in which lay a stone statue in human form, enclosing
     a man who had on his breast a golden pectoral, adorned with
     precious stones, and a sword of inestimable value, and on
     his head a carbuncle of the size of an egg, brilliant as the
     sun, having characters which no man can read." All the Arab
     authors, whose accounts have been collected by Jomard,
     relate in general the same story; one can easily recognize
     from this description the sarcophagus still in its place, a
     stone case in human shape, and the mummy of Kheops loaded
     with jewels and arms, like the body of Queen Âhhotpû I.

Four barriers in all were thus interposed between the external world and
the vault.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This appears to me to follow from the analogous
     arrangements which I met with in the pyramid of Saqqâra. Mr.
     Petrie refuses to recognize here a barrier chamber (cf. the
     notes which he has appended to the English translation of my
     <i>Archéologie égyptienne</i>, p. 327, note 27,) but he confesses
     that the arrangement of the grooves and of the flagstone is
     still an enigma to him. Perhaps only one of the four
     intended barriers was inserted in its place&mdash;that which
     still remains.
</pre>
<p>
The Great Pyramid was called Khûît, the "Horizon" in which Khûfûî had to
be swallowed up, as his father the Sun was engulfed every evening in
the horizon of the west. It contained only the chambers of the deceased,
without a word of inscription, and we should not know to whom it
belonged, if the masons, during its construction, had not daubed here
and there in red paint among their private marks the name of the king,
and the dates of his reign.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The workmen often drew on the stones the cartouches of the
     Pharaoh under whose reign they had been taken from the
     quarry, with the exact date of their extraction; the
     inscribed blocks of the pyramid of Kheops bear, among
     others, a date of the year XVI.
</pre>
<p>
Worship was rendered to this Pharaoh in a temple constructed a little in
front of the eastern side of the pyramid, but of which nothing remains
but a mass of ruins. Pharaoh had no need to wait until he was mummified
before he became a god; religious rites in his honour were established
on his accession; and many of the individuals who made up his court
attached themselves to his double long before his double had become
disembodied. They served him faithfully during their life, to repose
finally in his shadow in the little pyramids and mastabas which
clustered around him. Of Dadûfri, his immediate successor, we can
probably say that he reigned eight years;* but Khephren, the next son
who succeeded to the throne,** erected temples and a gigantic pyramid,
like his father.
</p>
<pre>
     * According to the arrangement proposed by E. de Rougé for
     the fragments of the Turin Canon. E. de Rougé reads the name
     Râ-tot-ef, and proposes to identify it with the Ratoises of
     the lists of Manetho, which the copyists had erroneously put
     out of its proper place. This identification has been
     generally accepted. Analogy compels us to read Dadûfrî, like
     Khâfrî, Menkaurî, in which case the hypothesis of de Rougé
     falls to the ground. The worship of Dadûfrî was renewed
     towards the Saite period, together with that of Kheops and
     Khephren, according to some tradition which connected his
     reign with that of these two kings. On the general scheme of
     the Manethonian history of these times, see Maspero, <i>Notes
     sur quelques points de Grammaire et d'Histoire dans le
     Recueil de Travaux</i>, vol. xvii. pp. 122-138.

     ** The Westcar Papyrus considers Khâfri to be the son of
     Khûfû; this falls in with information given us, in this
     respect, by Diodorus Siculus. The form which this historian
     assigns&mdash;I do not know on what authority&mdash;to the name of the
     king, Khabryies, is nearer the original than the Khephren of
     Herodotus.

<p>
He placed it some 394 feet to the south-west of that of Kheops; and
called it Ûîrû, the Great. It is, however, smaller than its neighbour,
and attains a height of only 443 feet, but at a distance the difference
in height disappears, and many travellers have thus been led to
attribute the same elevation to the two. The facing, of which about
one-fourth exists from the summit downwards, is of nummulite limestone,
compact, hard, and more homogeneous than that of the courses, with
rusty patches here and there due to masses of a reddish lichen, but
grey elsewhere, and with a low polish which, at a distance, reflects the
sun's rays. Thick walls of unwrought stone enclose the monument on
three sides, and there may be seen behind the west front, in an oblong
enclosure, a row of stone sheds hastily constructed of limestone and
Nile mud.

Here the labourers employed on the works came every evening to huddle
together, and the refuse of their occupation still encumbers the ruins
of their dwellings, potsherds, chips of various kinds of hard stone
which they had been cutting, granite, alabaster, diorite, fragments of
statues broken in the process of sculpture, and blocks of smooth granite
ready for use. The chapel commands a view of the eastern face of the
pyramid, and communicated by a paved causeway with the temple of the
Sphinx, to which it must have borne a striking resemblance.* The plan of
it can be still clearly traced on the ground, and the rubbish cannot
be disturbed without bringing to light portions of statues, vases, and
tables of offerings, some of them covered with hieroglyphs, like the
mace-head of white stone which belonged in its day to Khephren himself.
</p>
<pre>
     * The connection of the temple of the Sphinx with that of
     the second pyramid was discovered in December, 1880, during
     the last diggings of Mariette. I ought to say that the whole
     of that part of the building into which the passage leads
     shows traces of having been hastily executed, and at a time
     long after the construction of the rest of the edifice; it
     is possible that the present condition of the place does not
     date back further than the time of the Antonines, when the
     Sphinx was cleared for the last time in ancient days.

The internal arrangements of the pyramid are of the simplest character;
they consist of a granite-built passage carefully concealed in the north
face, running at first at an angle of 25°, and then horizontally, until
stopped by a granite barrier at a point which indicates a change of
direction; a second passage, which begins on the outside, at a distance
of some yards in advance of the base of the pyramid, and proceeds, after
passing through an unfinished chamber, to rejoin the first; finally, a
chamber hollowed in the rock, but surmounted by a pointed roof of fine
limestone slabs.

The sarcophagus was of granite, and, like that of Kheops, bore neither
the name of a king nor the representation of a god. The cover was fitted
so firmly to the trough that the Arabs could not succeed in detaching
it when they rifled the tomb in the year 1200 of our era; they were,
therefore, compelled to break through one of the sides with a hammer
before they could reach the coffin and take from it the mummy of the
Pharaoh.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The second pyramid was opened to Europeans in 1816 by
     Belzoni. The exact date of the entrance of the Arabs is
     given us by an inscription, written in ink, on one of the
     walls of the sarcophagus chamber: "Mohammed Ahmed Effendi,
     the quarryman, opened it; Othman Effendi was present, as
     well as the King Ali Mohammed, at the beginning and at the
     closing." The King Ali Mohammed was the son and successor of
     Saladin.
</pre>
<p>
Of Khephren's sons, Menkaûrî (Mykerinos), who was his successor, could
scarcely dream of excelling his father and grandfather;* his pyramid,
the Supreme&mdash;Hirû** &mdash;barely attained an elevation of 216 feet, and was
exceeded in height by those which were built at a later date.*** Up to
one-fourth of its height it was faced with syenite, and the remainder,
up to the summit, with limestone.****
</p>
<pre>
     * Classical tradition makes Mykerinos the son of Kheops.
     Egyptian tradition regards him as the son of Khephren, and
     with this agrees a passage in the Westcar Papyrus, in which
     a magician prophesies that after Kheops his son (Khâfrî)
     will yet reign, then the son of the latter (Menkaûrî), then
     a prince of another family.

     ** An inscription, unfortunately much mutilated, from the
     tomb of Tabhûni, gives an account of the construction of the
     pyramid, and of the transport of the sarcophagus.

     *** Professor Petrie reckons the exact height of the pyramid
     at 2564 ±15 or 2580 ± 2 inches; that is to say, 214 or 215
     feet in round numbers.

     **** According to Herodotus, the casing of granite extended
     to half the height. Diodorus states that it did not go
     beyond the fifteenth course. Professor Petrie discovered
     that there were actually sixteen lower courses in red
     granite.
</pre>
<p>
For lack of time, doubtless, the dressing of the granite was not
completed, but the limestone received all the polish it was capable of
taking. The enclosing wall was extended to the north so as to meet, and
become one with, that of the second pyramid. The temple was connected
with the plain by a long and almost straight causeway, which ran for
the greater part of its course* upon an embankment raised above the
neighbouring ground. This temple was in fair condition in the early
years of the eighteenth century,** and so much of it as has escaped
the ravages of the Mameluks, bears witness to the scrupulous care and
refined art employed in its construction.
</p>
<pre>
     * This causeway should not be confounded, as is frequently
     done, with that which may be seen at some distance to the
     east in the plain: the latter led to limestone quarries in
     the mountain to the south of the plateau on which the
     pyramids stand. These quarries were worked in very ancient
     times.

     ** Benoit de Maillet visited this temple between 1692 and
     1708. "It is almost square in form. There are to be found
     inside four pillars which doubtless supported a vaulted roof
     covering the altar of the idol, and one moved around these
     pillars as in an ambulatory. These stones were cased with
     granitic marble. I found some pieces still unbroken which
     had been attached to the stones with mastic. I believe that

Coming from the plain, we first meet with an immense halting-place
measuring 100 feet by 46 feet, and afterwards enter a large court with
an egress on each side: beyond this we can distinguish the ground-plan
only of five chambers, the central one, which is in continuation with
the hall, terminating at a distance of some 42 feet from the pyramid,
exactly opposite the middle point of the eastern face. The whole mass
of the building covers a rectangular area 184 feet long by a little
over 177 feet broad. Its walls, like those of the temple of the Sphinx,
contained a core of lime-stone 7 feet 10 inches thick, of which the
blocks have been so ingeniously put together as to suggest the idea that
the whole is cut out of the rock. This core was covered with a casing
of granite and alabaster, of which the remains preserve no trace of
hieroglyphs or of wall scenes: the founder had caused his name to be
inscribed on the statues, which received, on his behalf, the offerings,
and also on the northern face of the pyramid, where it was still shown
to the curious towards the first century of our era. The arrangement of
the interior of the pyramid is somewhat complicated, and bears witness
to changes brought unexpectedly about in the course of construction. The
original central mass probably did not exceed 180 feet in breadth at the
base, with a vertical height of 154 feet. It contained a sloping passage
cut into the hill itself, and an oblong low-roofed cell devoid of
ornament. The main bulk of the work had been already completed, and the
casing not yet begun, when it was decided to alter the proportions of
the whole.

     The drawing of it was published by Vyse, by Birch-Lenormant,
     and by Lepsius. Herr Sethe has recently revived an ancient

     Saite period, and he has added to archaeological
     considerations, up to that time alone brought to bear upon
     the question, new philological facts.
</pre>
<p>
Mykerinos was not, it appears, the eldest son and appointed heir of
Khephren; while still a mere prince he was preparing for himself a
pyramid similar to those which lie near the "Horizon," when the deaths
of his father and brother called him to the throne. What was sufficient
for him as a child, was no longer suitable for him as a Pharaoh; the
mass of the structure was increased to its present dimensions, and a new
inclined passage was effected in it, at the end of which a hall
panelled with granite gave access to a kind of antechamber.* The latter
communicated by a horizontal corridor with the first vault, which was
deepened for the occasion; the old entrance, now no longer of use, was
roughly filled up.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Vyse discovered here fragments of a granite sarcophagus,
     perhaps that of the queen; the legends which Herodotus (ii.
     134, 135), and several Greek authors after him, tell
     concerning this, show clearly that an ancient tradition
     assumed the existence of a female mummy in the third pyramid
     alongside of that of the founder Mykerinos.

     ** Vyse has noticed, in regard to the details of the
     structure, that the passage now filled up is the only one
     driven from the outside to the interior; all the others were
     made from the inside to the outside, and consequently at a
     period when this passage, being the only means of
     penetrating into the interior of the monument, had not yet
     received its present dimensions.
</pre>
<p>
Mykerinos did not find his last resting-place in this upper level of the
interior of the pyramid: a narrow passage, hidden behind the slabbing
of the second chamber, descended into a secret crypt, lined with granite
and covered with a barrel-vaulted roof. The sarcophagus was a single
block of blue-black basalt, polished, and carved into the form of a
house, with a façade having three doors and three openings in the form
of windows, the whole framed in a rounded moulding and surmounted by a
projecting cornice such as we are accustomed to see on the temples.*
</p>
<pre>
     * It was lost off the coast of Spain in the vessel which was
     bringing it to England. We have only the drawing remaining
     which was made at the time of its discovery, and published
     by Vyse. M. Borchardt has attempted to show that it was
     reworked under the XXVIth Saite dynasty as well as the
     wooden coffin of the king.
</pre>
<p>
The mummy-case of cedar-wood had a man's head, and was shaped to
the form of the human body; it was neither painted nor gilt, but an
inscription in two columns, cut on its front, contained the name of the
Pharaoh, and a prayer on his behalf: "Osiris, King of the two Egypts,
Menkaûrî, living eternally, given birth to by heaven, conceived by Nûît,
flesh of Sibii, thy mother Nûît has spread herself out over thee in
her name of 'Mystery of the Heavens,' and she has granted that thou
shouldest be a god, and that thou shouldest repulse thine enemies, O
King of the two Egypts, Menkaûrî, living eternally." The Arabs opened
the mummy to see if it contained any precious jewels, but found within
it only some leaves of gold, probably a mask or a pectoral covered
with hieroglyphs. When Vyse reopened the vault in 1837, the bones lay
scattered about in confusion on the dusty floor, mingled with bundles of
dirty rags and wrappings of yellowish woollen cloth.
</p>
<p>
The worship of the three great pyramid-building kings continued in
Memphis down to the time of the Greeks and Romans. Their statues, in
granite, limestone, and alabaster, were preserved also in the buildings
annexed to the temple of Phtah, where visitors could contemplate these
Pharaohs as they were when alive.

Those of Khephren show us the king at different ages, when young,
mature, or already in his decadence. They are in most cases cut out of
a breccia of green diorite, with long irregular yellowish veins, and of
such hardness that it is difficult to determine the tool with which they
were worked. The Pharaoh sits squarely on his royal throne, his hands on
his lap, his body firm and upright, and his head thrown back with a look
of self-satisfaction. A sparrow-hawk perched on the back of his seat
covers his head with its wings&mdash;an image of the god Horus protecting
his son. The modelling of the torso and legs of the largest of these
statues, the dignity of its pose, and the animation of its expression,
make of it a unique work of art which may be compared with the most
perfect products of antiquity. Even if the cartouches which tell us the
name of the king had been hammered away and the insignia of his rank
destroyed, we should still be able to determine the Pharaoh by his
bearing: his whole appearance indicates a man accustomed from his
infancy to feel himself invested with limitless authority. Mykerinos
stands out less impassive and haughty: he does not appear so far removed
from humanity as his predecessor, and the expression of his countenance
agrees, somewhat singularly, with the account of his piety and good
nature preserved by the legends. The Egyptians of the Theban dynasties,
when comparing the two great pyramids with the third, imagined that the
disproportion in their size corresponded with a difference of character
between their royal occupants. Accustomed as they were from infancy to
gigantic structures, they did not experience before "the Horizon" and
"the Great" the feeling of wonder and awe which impresses the beholder
of to-day. They were not the less apt on this account to estimate
the amount of labour and effort required to complete them from top to
bottom. This labour seemed to them to surpass the most excessive corvée
which a just ruler had a right to impose upon his subjects, and the
reputation of Kheops and Khephren suffered much in consequence. They
were accused of sacrilege, of cruelty, and profligacy.

<p>
It was urged against them that they had arrested the whole life of their
people for more than a century for the erection of their tombs.
Kheops began by closing the temples and by prohibiting the offering of
sacrifices: he then compelled all the Egyptians to work for him. To some
he assigned the task of dragging the blocks from the quarries of the
Arabian chain to the Nile: once shipped, the duty was incumbent on
others of transporting them as far as the Libyan chain. A hundred
thousand men worked at a time, and were relieved every three months.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Professor Petrie thinks that this detail rests upon an
     authentic tradition. The inundation, he says, lasts three
     months, during which the mass of the people have nothing to
     do; it was during these three months that Kheops raised the
     100,000 men to work at the transport of the stone. The
     explanation is very ingenious, but it is not supported by
     the text: Herodotus does not relate that 100,000 men were
     called by the corvée for three months every year; but from
     three months to three months, possibly four times a year,
     bodies of 100,000 men relieved each other at the work. The
     figures which he quotes are well-known legendary numbers,
     and we must leave the responsibility for them to the popular
     imagination (Wiedemann, Herodots Zweites Buck, p. 465).
</pre>
<p>
The period of the people's suffering was divided as follows: ten years
in making the causeway along which the blocks were dragged&mdash;a work, in
my opinion, very little less onerous than that of erecting the pyramid,
for its length was five <i>stadia</i>, its breadth ten <i>orgyio</i>, its greatest
height eight, and it was made of cut stone and covered with figures.*
Ten years, therefore, were consumed in constructing this causeway
and the subterranean chambers hollowed out in the hill.... As for the
pyramid itself, twenty years were employed in the making of it.... There
are recorded on it, in Egyptian characters, the value of the sums paid
in turnips, onions, and garlic, for the labourers attached to the works;
if I remember aright, the interpreter who deciphered the inscription
told me that the total amounted to sixteen hundred talents of silver.
If this were the case, how much must have been expended for iron to make
tools, and for provisions and clothing for the workmen?**
</p>
<pre>
     * Diodorus Siculus declares that there were no causeways to
     be seen in his time. The remains of one of them appear to
     have been discovered and restored by Vyse.

     ** Herodotus, ii. 124, 125. The inscriptions which were read
     upon the pyramids were the graffiti of visitors, some of
     them carefully executed. The figures which were shown to
     Herodotus represented, according to the dragoman, the value
     of the sums expended for vegetables for the workmen; we
     ought, probably, to regard them as the thousands which, in
     many of the votive temples, served to mark the quantities of
     different things presented to the god, that they might be
     transmitted to the deceased.
</pre>
<p>
The whole resources of the royal treasure were not sufficient for such
necessaries: a tradition represents Kheops as at the end of his means,
and as selling his daughter to any one that offered, in order to procure
money.* Another legend, less disrespectful to the royal dignity and to
paternal authority, assures us that he repented in his old age, and that
he wrote a sacred book much esteemed by the devout.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus, ii. 126. She had profited by what she received
     to build a pyramid for herself in the neighbourhood of the
     great one&mdash;the middle one of the three small pyramids: it
     would appear in fact, that this pyramid contained the mummy
     of a daughter of Kheops, Honîtsonû.

     ** Manetho, Unger's edition, p. 91. The ascription of a book
     to Kheops, or rather the account of the discovery of a
     "sacred book" under Kheops, is quite in conformity with
     Egyptian ideas. The British Museum possesses two books,
     which were thus discovered under this king; the one, a
     medical treatise, in a temple at Coptos; the other comes
     from Tanis. Among the works on alchemy published by M.
     Berthelot, there are two small treatises ascribed to Sophé,
     possibly Souphis or Kheops: they are of the same kind as the
     book mentioned by Manetho, and which Syncellus says was
     bought in Egypt.
</pre>
<p>
Khephren had imitated, and thus shared with, him, the hatred of
posterity. The Egyptians avoided naming these wretches: their work was
attributed to a shepherd called Philitis, who in ancient times pastured
his flocks in the mountain; and even those who did not refuse to them
the glory of having built the most enormous sepulchres in the world,
related that they had not the satisfaction of reposing in them after
their death. The people, exasperated at the tyranny to which they had
been subject, swore that they would tear the bodies of these Pharaohs
from their tombs, and scatter their fragments to the winds: they had
to be buried in crypts so securely placed that no one has succeeded in
finding them.
</p>
<p>
Like the two older pyramids, "the Supreme" had its anecdotal history,
in which the Egyptians gave free rein to their imagination. We know
that its plan had been rearranged in the course of building, that it
contained two sepulchral chambers, two sarcophagi, and two mummies:
these modifications, it was said, belonged to two distinct reigns; for
Mykerinos had left his tomb unfinished, and a woman had finished it at
a later date&mdash;according to some, Nitokris, the last queen of the VIth
dynasty; according to others, Rhodopis, the Ionian who was the mistress
of Psammetichus I. or of Ainasis.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Zoega had already recognized that the Rhodopis of the
     Greeks was no other than the Nitokris of Manetho, and his
     opinion was adopted and developed by Bunsen. The legend of
     Rhodopis was completed by the additional ascription to the
     ancient Egyptian queen of the character of a courtesan: this
     repugnant trait seems to have been borrowed from the same
     class of legends as that which concerned itself with the
     daughter of Kheops and her pyramid. The narrative thus
     developed was in a similar manner confounded with another
     popular story, in which occurs the episode of the slipper,
     so well known from the tale of Cinderella. Herodotus
     connects Rhodopis with his Amasis, Ælian with King
     Psammetichus of the XXVIth dynasty.
</pre>
<p>
The beauty and richness of the granite casing dazzled all eyes, and
induced many visitors to prefer the least of the pyramids to its two
imposing sisters; its comparatively small size is excused on the ground
that its founder had returned to that moderation and piety which
ought to characterize a good king. "The actions of his father were not
pleasing to him; he reopened the temples and sent the people, reduced
to the extreme of misery, back to their religious observances and their
occupations; finally, he administered justice more equitably than all
other kings. On this head he is praised above those who have at any time
reigned in Egypt: for not only did he administer good justice, but if
any one complained of his decision he gratified him with some present in
order to appease his wrath." There was one point, however, which excited
the anxiety of many in a country where the mystic virtue of numbers
was an article of faith: in order that the laws of celestial arithmetic
should be observed in the construction of the pyramids, it was necessary
that three of them should be of the same size. The anomaly of a third
pyramid out of proportion to the two others could be explained only on
the hypothesis that Mykerinos, having broken with paternal usage,
had ignorantly infringed a decree of destiny&mdash;a deed for which he was
mercilessly punished. He first lost his only daughter; a short time
after he learned from an oracle that he had only six more years to
remain upon the earth. He enclosed the corpse of his child in a hollow
wooden heifer, which he sent to Sais, where it was honoured with divine
worship.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Herodotus, ii. 129-133. The manner in which Herodotus
     describes the cow which was shown to him in the temple of
     Sais, proves that he was dealing with Nit, in animal form,
     Mihî-ûîrît, the great celestial heifer who had given birth
     to the Sun. How the people could have attached to this
     statue the legend of a daughter of Mykerinos is now
     difficult to understand. The idea of a mummy or a corpse
     shut up in a statue, or in a coffin, was familiar to the
     Egyptians: two of the queens interred at Déir el-Baharî,
     Nofritari Ahhotpû II., were found hidden in the centre of
     immense Osirian figures of wood, covered with stuccoed
     fabric. Egyptian tradition supposed that the bodies of the
     gods rested upon the earth. The cow Mîhî-ûîrît might,
     therefore, be bodily enclosed in a sarcophagus in the form
     of a heifer, just as the mummified gazelle of Déîr el-Baharî
     is enclosed in a sarcophagus of gazelle form; it is even
     possible that the statue shown to Herodotus really contained
     what was thought to be a mummy of the goddess.
</pre>
<p>
"He then communicated his reproaches to the god, complaining that his
father and his uncle, after having closed the temples, forgotten the
gods and oppressed mankind, had enjoyed a long life, while he, devout as
he was, was so soon about to perish. The oracle answered that it was for
this very reason that his days were shortened, for he had not done that
which he ought to have done. Egypt had to suffer for a hundred and fifty
years, and the two kings his predecessors had known this, while he had
not. On receiving this answer, Mykerinos, feeling himself condemned,
manufactured a number of lamps, lit them every evening at dusk, began to
drink and to lead a life of jollity, without ceasing for a moment night
and day, wandering by the lakes and in the woods wherever he thought to
find an occasion of pleasure. He had planned this in order to convince
the oracle of having spoken falsely, and to live twelve years, the
nights counting as so many days." Legend places after him Asychis or
Sasychis, a later builder of pyramids, but of a different kind. The
latter preferred brick as a building material, except in one place,
where he introduced a stone bearing the following inscription: "Do not
despise me on account of the stone pyramids: I surpass them as much as
Zeus the other gods. Because, a pole being plunged into a lake and the
clay which stuck to it being collected, the brick out of which I was
constructed was moulded from it." The virtues of Asychis and Mykerinos
helped to counteract the bad impression which Kheops and Khephren had
left behind them. Among the five legislators of Egypt Asychis stood out
as one of the best. He regulated, to minute details, the ceremonies of
worship. He invented geometry and the art of observing the heavens.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Diodorus, i. 94. It seems probable that Diodorus had
     received knowledge from some Alexandrian writer, now lost,
     of traditions concerning the legislative acts of Shashanqû
     I. of the XXIInd dynasty; but the name of the king, commonly
     written Sesonkhis, had been corrupted by the dragoman into
     Sasykhis.
</pre>
<p>
He put forth a law on lending, in which he authorized the borrower to
pledge in forfeit the mummy of his father, while the creditor had the
right of treating as his own the tomb of the debtor: so that if the
debt was not met, the latter could not obtain a last resting-place for
himself or his family either in his paternal or any other tomb.
</p>
<p>
History knows nothing either of this judicious sovereign or of many
other Pharaohs of the same type, which the dragomans of the Greek period
assiduously enforced upon the respectful attention of travellers. It
merely affirms that the example given by Kheops, Khephren, and Mykerinos
were by no means lost in later times. From the beginning of the IVth
to the end of the XIVth dynasty&mdash;during more than fifteen hundred
years&mdash;the construction of pyramids was a common State affair, provided
for by the administration, secured by special services. Not only did
the Pharaohs build them for themselves, but the princes and princesses
belonging to the family of the Pharaohs constructed theirs, each one
according to his resources; three of these secondary mausoleums are
ranged opposite the eastern side of "the Horizon," three opposite the
southern face of "the Supreme," and everywhere else&mdash;near Abousir, at
Saqqâra, at Dahshur or in the Fayûm&mdash;the majority of the royal pyramids
attracted around them a more or less numerous cortège of pyramids of
princely foundation often debased in shape and faulty in proportion. The
materials for them were brought from the Arabian chain. A spur of the
latter, projecting in a straight line towards the Nile, as far as
the village of Troiû, is nothing but a mass of the finest and whitest
limestone. The Egyptians had quarries here from the earliest times. By
cutting off the stone in every direction, they lowered the point of this
spur for a depth of some hundreds of metres. The appearance of these
quarries is almost as astonishing as that of the monuments made out of
their material. The extraction of the stone was carried on with a skill
and regularity which denoted ages of experience. The tunnels were so
made as to exhaust the finest and whitest seams without waste, and the
chambers were of an enormous extent; the walls were dressed, the pillars
and roofs neatly finished, the passages and doorways made of a regular
width, so that the whole presented more the appearance of a subterranean
temple than of a place for the extraction of building materials.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The description of the quarries of Turah, as they were at
     the beginning of the century, was somewhat briefly given by
     Jomard, afterwards more completely by Perring. During the
     last thirty years the Cairo masons have destroyed the
     greater part of the ancient remains formerly existing in
     this district, and have completely changed the appearance of
     the place.
</pre>
<p>
Hastily written graffiti, in red and black ink, preserve the names of
workmen, overseers, and engineers, who had laboured here at certain
dates, calculations of pay or rations, diagrams of interesting details,
as well as capitals and shafts of columns, which were shaped out on the
spot to reduce their weight for transport. Here and there true official
stelas are to be found set apart in a suitable place, recording that
after a long interruption such or such an illustrious sovereign had
resumed the excavations, and opened fresh chambers. Alabaster was met
with not far from here in the Wady Gerrauî. The Pharaohs of very early
times established a regular colony here, in the very middle of the
desert, to cut the material into small blocks for transport: a strongly
built dam, thrown across the valley, served to store up the winter and
spring rains, and formed a pond whence the workers could always supply
themselves with water. Kheops and his successors drew their alabaster
from Hâtnûbû, in the neighbourhood of Hermopolis, their granite from
Syene, their diorite and other hard rocks, the favourite material for
their sarcophagi, from the volcanic valleys which separate the Nile from
the Red Sea&mdash;especially from the Wady Hammamât. As these were the only
materials of which the quantity required could not be determined in
advance, and which had to be brought from a distance, every king was
accustomed to send the principal persons of his court to the quarries
of Upper Egypt, and the rapidity with which they brought back the stone
constituted a high claim on the favour of their master. If the building
was to be of brick, the bricks were made on the spot, in the plain
at the foot of the hills. If it was to be a limestone structure, the
neighbouring parts of the plateau furnished the rough material in
abundance. For the construction of chambers and for casing walls, the
rose granite of Elephantine and the limestone of Troiu were commonly
employed, but they were spared the labour of procuring these specially
for the occasion. The city of the White Wall had always at hand a supply
of them in its stores, and they might be drawn upon freely for public
buildings, and consequently for the royal tomb. The blocks chosen from
this reserve, and conveyed in boats close under the mountain-side, were
drawn up slightly inclined causeways by oxen to the place selected by
the architect.
</p>
<p>
The internal arrangements, the length of the passages and the height
of the pyramids, varied much: the least of them had a height of some
thirty-three feet merely. As it is difficult to determine the motives
which influenced the Pharaohs in building them of different sizes, some
writers have thought that the mass of each increased in proportion to
the time bestowed upon its construction&mdash;that is to say, to the length
of each reign. As soon as a prince mounted the throne, he would probably
begin by roughly sketching out a pyramid sufficiently capacious to
contain the essential elements of the tomb; he would then, from year to
year, have added fresh layers to the original nucleus, until the day of
his death put an end for ever to the growth of the monument.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This was the theory formulated by Lepsius, after the
     researches made by himself, and the work done by Erbkam, and
     the majority of Egyptologists adopted it, and still maintain
     it. It was vigorously attacked by Perrot-Chipiez and by
     Petrie; it was afterwards revived, with amendments, by
     Borchardt whose conclusions have been accepted by Ed. Meyer.
     The examinations which I have had the opportunity of
     bestowing on the pyramids of Saqqâra, Abusir, Dahshur,
     Rîgah, and Lisht have shown me that the theory is not
     applicable to any of these monuments.
</pre>
<p>
This hypothesis is not borne out by facts: such a small pyramid as that
of Saqqâra belonged to a Pharaoh who reigned thirty years, while
"the Horizon" of Gîzeh is the work of Kheops, whose rule lasted only
twenty-three years.

<p>
The plan of each pyramid was arranged once for all by the architect,
according to the instructions he had received, and the resources at his
command. Once set on foot, the work was continued until its completion,
without addition or diminution, unless something unforeseen occurred.
The pyramids, like the mastabas, ought to present their faces to the
four cardinal points; but owing to unskilfulness or negligence, the
majority of them are not very accurately orientated, and several of them
vary sensibly from the true north. The great pyramid of Saqqâra does not
describe a perfect square at its base, but is an oblong rectangle, with
its longest sides east and west; it is stepped&mdash;that is to say, the six
sloping sided cubes of which it is composed are placed upon one another
so as to form a series of treads and risers, the former being about two
yards wide and the latter of unequal heights. The highest of the stone
pyramids of Dahshur makes at its lower part an angle of 54° 41' with the
horizon, but at half its height the angle becomes suddenly more acute
and is reduced to 42° 59'. It reminds one of a mastaba with a sort of
huge attic on the top. Each of these monuments had its enclosing wall,
its chapel and its college of priests, who performed there for ages
sacred rites in honour of the deceased prince, while its property in
mortmain was administered by the chief of the "priests of the double."
Each one received a name, such as "the Fresh," "the Beautiful," "the
Divine in its places," which conferred upon it a personality and, as it
were, a living soul. These pyramids formed to the west of the White Wall
a long serrated line whose extremities were lost towards the south and
north in the distant horizon: Pharaoh could see them from the terraces
of his palace, from the gardens of his villa, and from every point in
the plain in which he might reside between Heliopolis and Mêdûm&mdash;as a
constant reminder of the lot which awaited him in spite of his divine
origin. The people, awed and inspired by the number of them, and by the
variety of their form and appearance, were accustomed to tell stories
of them to one another, in which the supernatural played a predominant
part. They were able to estimate within a few ounces the heaps of gold
and silver, the jewels and precious stones, which adorned the royal
mummies or rilled the sepulchral chambers: they were acquainted with
every precaution taken by the architects to ensure the safety of all
these riches from robbers, and were convinced that magic had added to
such safeguards the more effective protection of talismans and genii.
There was no pyramid so insignificant that it had not its mysterious
protectors, associated with some amulet&mdash;in most cases with a statue,
animated by the double of the founder. The Arabs of to-day are still
well acquainted with these protectors, and possess a traditional respect
for them. The great pyramid concealed a black and white image, seated
on a throne and invested with the kingly sceptre. He who looked upon the
statue "heard a terrible noise proceeding from it which almost caused
his heart to stop beating, and he who had heard this noise would die."
An image of rose-coloured granite watched over the pyramid of Khephren,
standing upright, a sceptre in its hand and the urous on its brow,
"which serpent threw himself upon him who approached it, coiled
itself around his neck, and killed him." A sorcerer had invested these
protectors of the ancient Pharaohs with their powers, but another
equally potent magician could elude their vigilance, paralyze their
energies, if not for ever, at least for a sufficient length of time
to ferret out the treasure and rifle the mummy. The cupidity of the
fellahîn, highly inflamed by the stories which they were accustomed to
hear, gained the mastery over their terror, and emboldened them to risk
their lives in these well-guarded tombs. How many pyramids had been
already rifled at the beginning of the second Theban empire!

The IVth dynasty became extinct in the person of Shop-siskaf, the
successor and probably the son of Mykerinos.* The learned of the time of
Ramses II. regarded the family which replaced this dynasty as merely
a secondary branch of the line of Snofrûi, raised to power by the
capricious laws which settled hereditary questions.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The series of kings beginning with Mykerinos was drawn up
     for the first time in an accurate manner by E. de Rougé,
     <i>recherches sur les Monu-mails qu'on peut attribuer aux six
     premières dynasties</i>, pp. 66-84, M. de Rouge's results have
     been since adopted by all Egyptologists. The table of the
     IVTH dynasty, restored as far as possible with the
     approximate dates, is subjoined:&mdash;

     ** The fragments of the royal Turin Papyrus exhibit, in
     fact, no separation between the kings which Manetho
     attributes to the IVth dynasty and those which he ascribes
     to the Vth, which seems to show that the Egyptian annalist
     considered them all as belonging to one and the same family
     of Pharaohs.
</pre>
<p>
Nothing on the contemporary monuments, it is true, gives indication of a
violent change attended by civil war, or resulting from a revolution at
court: the construction and decoration of the tombs continued without
interruption and without indication of haste, the sons-in-law of
Shopsiskaf and of Mykerinos, their daughters and grandchildren, possess
under the new kings, the same favour, the same property, the same
privileges, which they had enjoyed previously. It was stated, however,
in the time of the Ptolemies, that the Vth dynasty had no connection
with the IVth; it was regarded at Memphis as an intruder, and it was
asserted that it came from Elephantine.* The tradition was a very old
one, and its influence is betrayed in a popular story, which was current
at Thebes in the first years of the New Empire. Kheops, while in search
of the mysterious books of Thot in order to transcribe from them the
text for his sepulchral chamber,** had asked the magician Didi to be
good enough to procure them for him; but the latter refused the perilous
task imposed upon him.
</p>
<pre>
     * Such is the tradition accepted by Manetho. Lepsius thinks
     that the copyists of Manetho were under some distracting
     influence, which made them transfer the record of the origin
     of the VIth dynasty to the Vth: it must have been the VIth
     dynasty which took its origin from Elephantine. I think the
     safest plan is to respect the text of Manetho until we know
     more, and to admit that he knew of a tradition ascribing the
     origin of the Vth dynasty to Elephantine.

     ** The Great Pyramid is mute, but we find in other pyramids
     inscriptions of some hundreds of lines. The author of the
     story, who knew how much certain kings of the VIth dynasty
     had laboured to have extracts of the sacred books engraved
     within their tombs, fancied, no doubt, that his Kheops had
     done the like, but had not succeeded in procuring the texts
     in question, probably on account of the impiety ascribed to
     him by the legends. It was one of the methods of explaining
     the absence of any religious or funereal inscription in the
     Great Pyramid.
</pre>
<p>
"'Sire, my lord, it is not I who shall bring them to thee.' His Majesty
asks: 'Who, then, will bring them to me?' Didi replies, 'It is the
eldest of the three children who are in the womb of Rudîtdidît who will
bring them to thee.' His Majesty says: 'By the love of Râ! what is this
that thou tellest me; and who is she, this Rudîtdidît?' Didi says to
him: 'She is the wife of a priest of Râ, lord of Sakhîbû. She carries in
her womb three children of Râ, lord of Sakhîbû, and the god has promised
to her that they shall fulfil this beneficent office in this whole
earth,* and that the eldest shall be the high priest at Heliopolis." His
Majesty, his heart was troubled at it, but Didi says to him: "'What are
these thoughts, sire, my lord? Is it because of these three children?
Then I say to thee: 'Thy son, his son, then one of these.'"** The good
King Kheops doubtless tried to lay his hands upon this threatening trio
at the moment of their birth; but Râ had anticipated this, and saved his
offspring. When the time for their birth drew near, the Majesty of Râ,
lord of Sakhîbû, gave orders to Isis, Nephthys, Maskhonît, Hiquît,***
and Khnûmû: "Come, make haste and run to deliver Budîtdidît of these
three children which she carries in her womb to fulfil that beneficent
office in this whole earth, and they will build you temples, they will
furnish your altars with offerings, they will supply your tables with
libations, and they will increase your mortmain possessions."
</p>
<pre>
     * This kind of circumlocution is employed on several
     occasions in the old texts to designate royalty. It was
     contrary to etiquette to mention directly, in common speech,
     the Pharaoh, or anything belonging to his functions or his
     family. Cf. pp. 28, 29 of this History.

     ** This phrase is couched in oracular form, as befitting the
     reply of a magician. It appears to have been intended to
     reassure the king in affirming that the advent of the three
     sons of Râ would not be immediate: his son, then a son of
     this son, would succeed him before destiny would be
     accomplished, and one of these divine children succeed to
     the throne in his turn. The author of the story took no
     notice of Dadufrî or Shopsiskaf, of whose reigns little was
     known in his time.

     *** Hiquît as the frog-goddess, or with a frog's head, was
     one of the mid-wives who is present at the birth of the sun
     every morning. Her presence is, therefore, natural in the
     case of the spouse about to give birth to royal sons of the
     sun.
</pre>
<p>
The goddesses disguised themselves as dancers and itinerant musicians:
Khnûmû assumed the character of servant to this band of nautch-girls and
filled the bag with provisions, and they all then proceeded together
to knock at the door of the house in which Budîtdidît was awaiting her
delivery. The earthly husband Baûsîr, unconscious of the honour that the
gods had in store for him, introduced them to the presence of his wife,
and immediately three male children were brought into the world one
after the other. Isis named them, Maskhonît predicted for them their
royal fortune, while Khnûmû. infused into their limbs vigour and health;
the eldest was called Ûsirkaf, the second Sahûrî, the third Kakiû.
Kaûsîr was anxious to discharge his obligation to these unknown persons,
and proposed to do so in wheat, as if they were ordinary mortals: they
had accepted it without compunction, and were already on their way to
the firmament, when Isis recalled them to a sense of their dignity, and
commanded them to store the honorarium bestowed upon them in one of
the chambers of the house, where henceforth prodigies of the strangest
character never ceased to manifest themselves. Every time one entered
the place a murmur was heard of singing, music, and dancing, while
acclamations such as those with which kings are wont to be received gave
sure presage of the destiny which awaited the newly born. The manuscript
is mutilated, and we do not know how the prediction was fulfilled. If we
may trust the romance, the three first princes of the Vth dynasty were
brothers, and of priestly descent, but our experience of similar stories
does not encourage us to take this one very seriously: did not such
tales affirm that Kheops and Khephren were brothers also?
</p>
<p>
The Vth dynasty manifested itself in every respect as the sequel and
complement of the IVth.* It reckons nine Pharaohs after the three which
tradition made sons of the god Râ himself and of Rudîtdidîfc. They
reigned for a century and a half; the majority of them have left
monuments, and the last four, at least, Ûsirnirî Ânû, Menkaû-horû,
Dadkerî Assi, and Unas, appear to have ruled gloriously. They all built
pyramids,** they repaired temples and founded cities.***

     dynasty, restored as far as can be, with the closest
     approximate dates of their reigns:&mdash;

     ** It is pretty generally admitted, but without convincing
     proofs, that the pyramids of Abûsîr served as tombs for the
     Pharaohs in the Vth dynasty, one for Sahûrî, another to
     Ûsirnirî Anû, although Wiedemann considers that the
     truncated pyramid of Dahshur was the tomb of this king. I am
     inclined to think that one of the pyramids of Saqqâra was
     constructed by Assi; the pyramid of Unas was opened in 1881,
     and the results made known by Maspero, <i>Études de Mythologie
     et d'Archéologie</i>, vol. i. p. 150, et seq., and <i>Recueil de
     Travaux</i>, vols. iv. and v. The names of the majority of the
     pyramids are known to us from the monuments: that of Ûsirkaf
     was called "Ûâbisîtu"; that of Sahûrî, "Khâbi"; that of
     Nofiririkerî, "Bi"; that of Anû, "Min-isûîtû"; that of
     Menkaûhorû, "Nûtirisûîtû"; that of Assi, "Nutir"; that of
     Unas, "Nofir-isûîtû."

     *** Pa Sahûrî, near Esneh, for instance, was built by
     Sahûrî. The modern name of the village of Sahoura still
     preserves, on the same spot, without the inhabitants
     suspecting it, the name of the ancient Pharaoh.

The Bedouin of the Sinaitic peninsula gave them much to do. Sahûrî
brought these nomads to reason, and perpetuated the memory of his
victories by a stele, engraved on the face of one of the rocks in the
Wady Magharah; Anû obtained some successes over them, and Assi repulsed
them in the fourth year of his reign. On the whole, they maintained
Egypt in the position of prosperity and splendour to which their
predecessors had raised it.
</p>
<p>
In one respect they even increased it. Egypt was not so far isolated
from the rest of the world as to prevent her inhabitants from knowing,
either by personal contact or by hearsay, at least some of the peoples
dwelling outside Africa, to the north and east.

They knew that beyond the "Very Green," almost at the foot of the
mountains behind which the sun travelled during the night, stretched
fertile islands or countries and nations without number, some barbarous
or semi-barbarous, others as civilized as they were themselves. They
cared but little by what names they were known, but called them all by
a common epithet, the Peoples beyond the Seas, "Haûi-nîbû." If they
travelled in person to collect the riches which were offered to them by
these peoples in exchange for the products of the Nile, the Egyptians
could not have been the unadventurous and home-loving people we have
imagined. They willingly left their own towns in pursuit of fortune
or adventure, and the sea did not inspire them with fear or religious
horror. The ships which they launched upon it were built on the model of
the Nile boats, and only differed from the latter in details which would
now pass unnoticed. The hull, which was built on a curved keel, was
narrow, had a sharp stem and stern, was decked from end to end, low
forward and much raised aft, and had a long deck cabin: the steering
apparatus consisted of one or two large stout oars, each supported on
a forked post and managed by a steersman. It had one mast, sometimes
composed of a single tree, sometimes formed of a group of smaller masts
planted at a slight distance from each other, but united at the top by
strong ligatures and strengthened at intervals by crosspieces which made
it look like a ladder; its single sail was bent sometimes to one yard,
sometimes to two; while its complement consisted of some fifty men,
oarsmen, sailors, pilots, and passengers. Such were the vessels for
cruising or pleasure; the merchant ships resembled them, but they were
of heavier build, of greater tonnage, and had a higher freeboard. They
had no hold; the merchandise had to remain piled up on deck, leaving
only just enough room for the working of the vessel. They nevertheless
succeeded in making lengthy voyages, and in transporting troops into the
enemy's territory from the mouths of the Nile to the southern coast of
Syria. Inveterate prejudice alone could prevent us from admitting that
the Egyptians of the Memphite period went to the ports of Asia and to
the Haûi-nîbû by sea. Some, at all events, of the wood required for
building* and for joiner's work of a civil or funereal character, such
as pine, cypress or cedar, was brought from the forests of Lebanon or
those of Amanus.
</p>
<pre>
     * Cedar-wood must have been continually imported into Egypt.
     It is mentioned in the Pyramid texts; in the tomb of Ti, and
     in the other tombs of Saqqâra or Gîzeh, workmen are
     represented making furniture of it. Chips of wood from the
     coffins of the VIth dynasty, detached in ancient times and
     found in several mastabas at Saqqâra, have been pronounced
     to be, some cedar of Lebanon, others a species of pine which
     still grows in Cilicia and in the north of Syria.

Beads of amber are still found near Abydos in the tombs of the oldest
necropolis, and we may well ask how many hands they had passed through
before reaching the banks of the Nile from the shores of the Baltic.*
The tin used to alloy copper for making bronze,** and perhaps bronze
itself, entered doubtless by the same route as the amber.
</p>
<pre>
     * I have picked up in the tombs of the VIth dynasty at Kom-
     es-Sultan, and in the part of the necropolis of Abydos
     containing the tombs of the XIth and XIIth dynasties, a
     number of amber beads, most of which were very small.
     Mariette, who had found some on the same site, and who had
     placed them in the Boulaq Museum, mistook them for corroded
     yellow or brown glass beads. The electric properties which
     they still possess have established their identity.

     ** I may recall the fact that the analysis of some objects
     discovered at Mèdûm by Professor Petrie proved that they
     were made of bronze, and contained 9.l per cent, of tin; the
     Egyptians, therefore, used bronze from the IVth dynasty
     downwards, side by side with pure copper.
</pre>
<p>
The tribes of unknown race who then peopled the coasts of the Ægean Sea,
were amongst the latest to receive these metals, and they transmitted
them either directly to the Egyptians or Asiatic intermediaries, who
carried them to the Nile Valley. Asia Minor had, moreover, its treasures
of metal as well as those of wood&mdash;copper, lead, and iron, which
certain tribes of miners and smiths, had worked from the earliest times.
Caravans plied between Egypt and the lands of Chaldæan civilization,
crossing Syria and Mesopotamia, perhaps even by the shortest desert
route, as far as Ur and Babylon. The communications between nation and
nation were frequent from this time forward, and very productive, but
their existence and importance are matters of inference, as we have no
direct evidence of them. The relations with these nations continued to
be pacific, and, with the exception of Sinai, Pharaoh had no desire to
leave the Nile Valley and take long journeys to pillage or subjugate
countries from whence came so much treasure. The desert and the sea
which protected Egypt on the north and east from Asiatic cupidity,
protected Asia with equal security from the greed of Egypt.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, towards the south, the Nile afforded an easy means
of access to those who wished to penetrate into the heart of Africa. The
Egyptians had, at the outset, possessed only the northern extremity of
the valley, from the sea to the narrow pass of Silsileh; they had then
advanced as far as the first cataract, and Syene for some time marked
the extreme limit of their empire. At what period did they cross this
second frontier and resume their march southwards, as if again to seek
the cradle of their race? They had approached nearer and nearer to the
great bend described by the river near the present village of Korosko,*
but the territory thus conquered had, under the Vth dynasty, not as yet
either name or separate organization: it was a dependency of the fiefdom
of Elephantine, and was under the immediate authority of its princes.
</p>
<pre>
     * This appears to follow from a passage in the inscription
     of Uni. This minister was raising troops and exacting wood
     for building among the desert tribes whose territories
     adjoined at this part of the valley: the manner in which the
     requisitions were effected shows that it was not a question
     of a new exaction, but a familiar operation, and
     consequently that the peoples mentioned had been under
     regular treaty obligations to the Egyptians, at least for
     some time previously.
</pre>
<p>
Those natives who dwelt on the banks of the river appear to have offered
but a slight resistance to the invaders: the desert tribes proved more
difficult to conquer. The Nile divided them into two distinct bodies. On
the right side, the confederation of the Uaûaiu spread in the direction
of the Bed Sea, from the district around Ombos to the neighbourhood of
Korosko, in the valleys now occupied by the Ababdehs: it was bounded on
the south by the Mâzaiû tribes, from whom our contemporary Mâazeh have
probably descended. The Amamiu were settled on the left bank opposite
to the Mâzaiû, and the country of Iritît lay facing the territory of the
Uaûaiu. None of these barbarous peoples were subject to Egypt, but
they all acknowledged its suzerainty,&mdash;a somewhat dubious one, indeed,
analogous to that exercised over their descendants by the Khedives of
to-day. The desert does not furnish them with the means of subsistence:
the scanty pasturages of their wadys support a few flocks of sheep and
asses, and still fewer oxen, but the patches of cultivation which they
attempt in the neighbourhood of springs, yield only a poor produce of
vegetables or dourah. They would literally die of starvation were they
not able to have access to the banks of the Nile for provisions. On
the other hand, it is a great temptation to them to fall unawares on
villages or isolated habitations on the outskirts of the fertile lands,
and to carry off cattle, grain, and male and female slaves; they would
almost always have time to reach the mountains again with their spoil
and to protect themselves there from pursuit, before even the news
of the attack could reach the nearest police station. Under treaties
concluded with the authorities of the country, they are permitted to
descend into the plain in order to exchange peaceably for corn and
dourah, the acacia-wood of their forests, the charcoal that they make,
gums, game, skins of animals, and the gold and precious stones which
they get from their mines: they agree in return to refrain from any
act of plunder, and to constitute a desert police, provided that they
receive a regular pay.

</center>

<p>
The same arrangement existed in ancient times. The tribes hired
themselves out to Pharaoh. They brought him beams of "sont" at the first
demand, when he was in need of materials to build a fleet beyond the
first cataract. They provided him with bands of men ready armed, when
a campaign against the Libyans or the Asiatic tribes forced him to seek
recruits for his armies: the Mâzaiû entered the Egyptian service in such
numbers, that their name served to designate the soldiery in general,
just as in Cairo porters and night watchmen are all called Berberines.
Among these people respect for their oath of fealty yielded sometimes
to their natural disposition, and they allowed themselves to be carried
away to plunder the principalities which they had agreed to defend: the
colonists in Nubia were often obliged to complain of their exactions.
When these exceeded all limits, and it became impossible to wink at
their misdoings any longer, light-armed troops were sent against
them, who quickly brought them to reason. As at Sinai, these were easy
victories. They recovered in one expedition what the Ûaûaiû had
stolen in ten, both in flocks and fellahîn, and the successful general
perpetuated the memory of his exploits by inscribing, as he returned,
the name of Pharaoh on some rock at Syene or Elephantine: we may surmise
that it was after this fashion that Usirkaf, Nofiririkerî, and Unas
carried on the wars in Nubia. Their armies probably never went beyond
the second cataract, if they even reached so far: further south the
country was only known by the accounts of the natives or by the few
merchants who had made their way into it. Beyond the Mâzaiû, but still
between the Nile and the Red Sea, lay the country of Pûanît, rich in
ivory, ebony, gold, metals, gums, and sweet-smelling resins. When some
Egyptian, bolder than his fellows, ventured to travel thither, he could
choose one of several routes for approaching it by land or sea. The
navigation of the Red Sea was, indeed, far more frequent than is usually
believed, and the same kind of vessels in which the Egyptians coasted
along the Mediterranean, conveyed them, by following the coast of
Africa, as far as the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. They preferred, however,
to reach it by land, and they returned with caravans of heavily laden
asses and slaves.

All that lay beyond Pûanît was held to be a fabulous region, a kind
of intermediate boundary land between the world of men and that of the
gods, the "Island of the Double," "Land of the Shades," where the living
came into close contact with the souls of the departed. It was inhabited
by the Dangas, tribes of half-savage dwarfs, whose grotesque faces and
wild gestures reminded the Egyptians of the god Bîsû (Bes). The chances
of war or trade brought some of them from time to time to Pûanît, or
among the Amamiû: the merchant who succeeded in acquiring and bringing
them to Egypt had his fortune made. Pharaoh valued the Dangas highly,
and was anxious to have some of them at any price among the dwarfs with
whom he loved to be surrounded; none knew better than they the dance
of the god&mdash;that to which Bîsû unrestrainedly gave way in his merry
moments. Towards the end of his reign Assi procured one which a certain
Biûrdidi had purchased in Pûanît. Was this the first which had made its
appearance at court, or had others preceded it in the good graces of
the Pharaohs? His wildness and activity, and the extraordinary positions
which he assumed, made a lively impression upon the courtiers of the
time, and nearly a century later there were still reminiscences of him.

<p>
A great official born in the time of Shopsiskaf, and living on to a
great age into the reign of Nofiririkerî, is described on his tomb as
the "Scribe of the House of Books." This simple designation, occurring
incidentally among two higher titles, would have been sufficient
in itself to indicate the extraordinary development which Egyptian
civilization had attained at this time. The "House of Books" was
doubtless, in the first place, a depository of official documents, such
as the registers of the survey and taxes, the correspondence between
the court and the provincial governors or feudal lords, deeds of gift
to temples or individuals, and all kinds of papers required in the
administration of the State. It contained I also, however, literary
works, many of which even at this early date were already old, prayers
drawn up during the first dynasties, devout poetry belonging to times
prior to the misty personage called Mini&mdash;hymns to the gods of light,
formulas of black magic, collections of mystical works, such as the
"Book of the Dead"* and the "Ritual of the Tomb;" scientific treatises
on medicine, geometry, mathematics, and astronomy; manuals of practical
morals; and lastly, romances, or those marvellous stories which preceded
the romance among Oriental peoples.
</p>
<pre>
     * The "Book of the Dead" must have existed from
     prehistoric times, certain chapters excepted, whose
     relatively modern origin has been indicated by those who
     ascribe the editing of the work to the time of the first
     human dynasties.
</pre>
<p>
All these, if we had them, would form "a library much more precious to
us than that of Alexandria;" unfortunately up to the present we have
been able to collect only insignificant remains of such rich stores. In
the tombs have been found here and there fragments of popular songs.
The pyramids have furnished almost intact a ritual of the dead which
is distinguished by its verbosity, its numerous pious platitudes, and
obscure allusions to things of the other world; but, among all this
trash, are certain portions full of movement and savage vigour, in which
poetic glow and religious emotion reveal their presence in a mass of
mythological phraseology. In the Berlin Papyrus we may read the end of
a philosophic dialogue between an Egyptian and his soul, in which the
latter applies himself to show that death has nothing terrifying to man.
"I say to myself every day: As is the convalescence of a sick person,
who goes to the court after his affliction, such is death.... I say to
myself every day: As is the inhaling of the scent of a perfume, as a
seat under the protection of an outstretched curtain, on that day, such
is death.... I say to myself every day: As the inhaling of the odour
of a garden of flowers, as a seat upon the mountain of the Country of
Intoxication, such is death.... I say to myself every day: As a road
which passes over the flood of inundation, as a man who goes as a
soldier whom nothing resists, such is death.... I say to myself every
day: As the clearing again of the sky, as a man who goes out to catch
birds with a net, and suddenly finds himself in an unknown district,
such is death." Another papyrus, presented by Prisse d'Avennes to the
<i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i>, Paris, contains the only complete work of
their primitive wisdom which has come down to us. It was certainly
transcribed before the XVIIIth dynasty, and contains the works of two
classic writers, one of whom is assumed to have lived under the
IIIrd and the other under the Vth dynasty; it is not without reason,
therefore, that it has been called "the oldest book in the world." The
first leaves are wanting, and the portion preserved has, towards
its end, the beginning of a moral treatise attributed to Qaqimnî, a
contemporary of Hûni. Then followed a work now lost: one of the
ancient possessors of the papyrus having effaced it with the view of
substituting for it another piece, which was never transcribed.
</p>
<p>
The last fifteen pages are occupied by a kind of pamphlet, which has
had a considerable reputation, under the name of the "Proverbs of
Phtahhotpû."
</p>
<p>
This Phtahhotpû, a king's son, flourished under Menkaûhorû and Assi: his
tomb is still to be seen in the necropolis of Saqqâra. He had sufficient
reputation to permit the ascription to him, without violence to
probability, of the editing of a collection of political and moral
maxims which indicate a profound knowledge of the court and of men
generally. It is supposed that he presented himself, in his declining
years, before the Pharaoh Assi, exhibited to him the piteous state to
which old age had reduced him, and asked authority to hand down for the
benefit of posterity the treasures of wisdom which he had stored up in
his long career. The nomarch Phtahhotpû says: "'Sire, my lord, when
age is at that point, and decrepitude has arrived, debility comes and
a second infancy, upon which misery falls heavily every day: the eyes
become smaller, the ears narrower, strength is worn out while the heart
continues to beat; the mouth is silent and speaks no more; the heart
becomes darkened and no longer remembers yesterday; the bones become
painful, everything which was good becomes bad, taste vanishes entirely;
old age renders a man miserable in every respect, for his nostrils close
up, and he breathes no longer, whether he rises up or sits down. If the
humble servant who is in thy presence receives an order to enter on a
discourse befitting an old man, then I will tell to thee the language
of those who know the history of the past, of those who have heard
the gods; for if thou conductest thyself like them, discontent shall
disappear from among men, and the two lands shall work for thee!' The
majesty of this god says: 'Instruct me in the language of old times, for
it will work a wonder for the children of the nobles; whosoever enters
and understands it, his heart weighs carefully what it says, and it does
not produce satiety.'" We must not expect to find in this work any great
profundity of thought. Clever analyses, subtle discussions, metaphysical
abstractions, were not in fashion in the time of Phtahhotpû. Actual
facts were preferred to speculative fancies: man himself was the subject
of observation, his passions, his habits, his temptations and his
defects, not for the purpose of constructing a system therefrom, but in
the hope of reforming the imperfections of his nature and of pointing
out to him the road to fortune. Phtahhotpû, therefore, does not show
much invention or make deductions. He writes down his reflections just
as they occur to him, without formulating them or drawing any conclusion
from them as a whole. Knowledge is indispensable to getting on in the
world; hence he recommends knowledge. Gentleness to subordinates is
politic, and shows good education; hence he praises gentleness. He
mingles advice throughout on the behaviour to be observed in the various
circumstances of life, on being introduced into the presence of a
haughty and choleric man, on entering society, on the occasion of dining
with a dignitary, on being married. "If thou art wise, thou wilt go
up into thine house, and love thy wife at home; thou wilt give her
abundance of food, thou wilt clothe her back with garments; all that
covers her limbs, her perfumes, is the joy of her life; as long as thou
lookest to this, she is as a profitable field to her master." To analyse
such a work in detail is impossible: it is still more impossible to
translate the whole of it. The nature of the subject, the strangeness of
certain precepts, the character of the style, all tend to disconcert the
reader and to mislead him in his interpretations. From the very earliest
times ethics has been considered as a healthy and praiseworthy subject
in itself, but so hackneyed was it, that a change in the mode of
expressing it could alone give it freshness. Phtahhotpû is a victim
to the exigencies of the style he adopted. Others before him had given
utterance to the truths he wished to convey: he was obliged to clothe
them in a startling and interesting form to arrest the attention of his
readers. In some places he has expressed his thought with such subtlety,
that the meaning is lost in the jingle of the words. The art of the
Memphite dynasties has suffered as much as the literature from the
hand of time, but in the case of the former the fragments are at least
numerous and accessible to all. The kings of this period erected temples
in their cities, and, not to speak of the chapel of the Sphinx, we find
in the remains still existing of these buildings chambers of granite,
alabaster and limestone, covered with religious scenes like those of
more recent periods, although in some cases the walls are left bare.
Their public buildings have all, or nearly all, perished; breaches have
been made in them by invading armies or by civil wars, and they have
been altered, enlarged, and restored scores of times in the course of
ages; but the tombs of the old kings remain, and afford proof of the
skill and perseverance exhibited by the architects in devising and
carrying out their plans. Many of the mastabas occurring at intervals
between Gîzeh and Mêdûm have, indeed, been hastily and carelessly built,
as if by those who were anxious to get them finished, or who had an eye
to economy; we may observe in all of them neglect and imperfection,&mdash;all
the trade-tricks which an unscrupulous jerry-builder then, as now, could
be guilty of, in order to keep down the net cost and satisfy the natural
parsimony of his patrons without lessening his own profits.* Where,
however, the master-mason has not been hampered by being forced to work
hastily or cheaply, he displays his conscientiousness, and the choice of
materials, the regularity of the courses, and the homogeneousness of the
building leave nothing to be desired; the blocks are adjusted with such
precision that the joints are almost invisible, and the mortar between
them has been spread with such a skilful hand that there is scarcely an
appreciable difference in its uniform thickness.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The similarity of the materials and technicalities of
     construction and decoration seem to me to prove that the
     majority of the tombs were built by a small number of
     contractors or corporations, lay or ecclesiastical, both at
     Memphis, under the Ancient, as well as at Thebes, under the
     New Empire.

     ** Speaking of the Great Pyramid and of its casing,
     Professor Petrie says: "Though the stones were brought as
     close as [&mdash;] inch, or, in fact, into contact, and the mean
     opening of the joint was but [&mdash;] inch, yet the builders
     managed to fill the joint with cement, despite the great
     area of it, and the weight of the stone to be moved&mdash;some 16
     tons. To merely place such stones in exact contact at the
     sides would be careful work; but to do so with cement in the
     joint seems almost impossible."
</pre>
<p>
The long low flat mass which the finished tomb presented to the eye
is wanting in grace, but it has the characteristics of strength and
indestructibility well suited to an "eternal house." The façade,
however, was not wanting in a certain graceful severity: the play of
light and shade distributed over its surface by the stelæ, niches, and
deep-set doorways, varied its aspect in the course of the day, without
lessening the impression of its majesty and serenity which nothing
could disturb. The pyramids themselves are not, as we might imagine,
the coarse and ill-considered reproduction of a mathematical figure
disproportionately enlarged. The architect who made an estimate for that
of Kheops, must have carefully thought out the relative value of the
elements contained in the problem which had to be solved&mdash;the vertical
height of the summit, the length of the sides on the ground line,
the angle of pitch, the inclination of the lateral faces to one
another&mdash;before he discovered the exact proportions and the arrangement
of lines which render his monument a true work of art, and not merely a
costly and mechanical arrangement of stones.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Cf. Borchardt's article, <i>Wie wurden die Boschungen der
     Pyramiden bestimmt?</i> in which the author&mdash;an architect by
     profession as well as an Egyptologist&mdash;interprets the
     theories and problems of the <i>Rhind mathematical Papyrus</i> in
     a new manner, comparing the result with his own
     calculations, made from measurements of pyramids still
     standing, and in which he shows, by an examination of the
     diagrams discovered on the wall of a mastaba at Mêdûm, that
     the Egyptian contractors of the Memphite period were, at
     that early date, applying the rules and methods of procedure
     which we find set forth in the Papyri of Theban times.
</pre>
<p>
The impressions which he desired to excite, have been felt by all who
came after him when brought face to face with the pyramids. From a great
distance they appear like mountain-peaks, breaking the monotony of the
Libyan horizon; as we approach them they apparently decrease in size,
and seem to be merely unimportant inequalities of ground on the surface
of the plain. It is not till we reach their bases that we guess their
enormous size. The lower courses then stretch seemingly into infinity to
right and left, while the summit soars up out of our sight into the sky.
"The effect is gained by majesty and simplicity of form, in the contrast
and disproportion between the stature of man and the immensity of his
handiwork: the eye fails to take it in; it is even difficult for the
mind to grasp it. We see, we may touch hundreds of courses formed of
blocks, two hundred cubic feet in size,... and thousands of others
scarcely less in bulk, and wo are at a loss to know what force has
moved, transported, and raised so great a number of colossal stones, how
many men were needed for the work, what amount of time was required
for it, what machinery they used; and in proportion to our inability to
answer these questions, we increasingly admire the power which regarded
such obstacles as trifles."
</p>
<p>
We are not acquainted with the names of any of the men who conceived
these prodigious works. The inscriptions mention in detail the princes,
nobles, and scribes who presided over all the works undertaken by the
sovereign, but they have never deigned to record the name of a single
architect.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The title "mir kaûtû nîbû nîti sûton," frequently met
     with under the Ancient Empire, does not designate the
     architects, as many Egyptologists have thought: it signifies
     "director of all the king's works," and is applicable to
     irrigation, dykes and canals, mines and quarries, and all
     branches of an engineer's profession, as well as to those of
     the architect's. The "directors of all the king's works "
     were dignitaries deputed by Pharaoh to take the necessary
     measurements for the building of temples, for dredging
     canals, for quarrying stone and minerals; they were
     administrators, and not professionals possessing the
     technical knowledge of an architect or engineer.

They were people of humble extraction, living hard lives under fear of
the stick, and their ordinary assistants, the draughtsmen, painters, and
sculptors, were no better off than themselves; they were looked upon
as mechanics of the same social status as the neighbouring shoemaker or
carpenter. The majority of them were, in fact, clever mechanical workers
of varying capability, accustomed to chisel out a bas-relief or set a
statue firmly on its legs, in accordance with invariable rules which
they transmitted unaltered from one generation to another: some were
found among them, however, who displayed unmistakable genius in
their art, and who, rising above the general mediocrity, produced
masterpieces. Their equipment of tools was very simple&mdash;iron picks with
wooden handles, mallets of wood, small hammers, and a bow for boring
holes. The sycamore and acacia furnished them with a material of a
delicate grain and soft texture, which they used to good advantage:
Egyptian art has left us nothing which, in purity of Hue and delicacy of
modelling, surpasses the panels of the tomb of Hosi, with their seated
or standing male figures and their vigorously cut hieroglyphs in the
same relief as the picture. Egypt possesses, however, but few trees of
suitable fibre for sculptural purposes, and even those which were
fitted for this use were too small and stunted to furnish blocks of any
considerable size. The sculptor, therefore, turned by preference to the
soft white limestone of Turah.
</p>




<p>
He quickly detached the general form of his statue from the mass of
stone, fixed the limits of its contour by means of dimension guides
applied horizontally from top to bottom, and then cut away the angles
projecting beyond the guides, and softened off the outline till he made
his modelling correct. This simple and regular method of procedure was
not suited to hard stone: the latter had to be first chiselled, but when
by dint of patience the rough hewing had reached the desired stage, the
work of completion was not entrusted to metal tools. Stone hatchets
were used for smoothing off the superficial roughnesses, and it was
assiduously polished to efface the various tool-marks left upon
its surface. The statues did not present that variety of gesture,
expression, and attitude which we aim at to-day. They were, above
all things, the accessories of a temple or tomb, and their appearance
reflects the particular ideas entertained with regard to their nature.
The artists did not seek to embody in them the ideal type of male
or female beauty: they were representatives made to perpetuate the
existence of the model.

The Egyptians wished the double to be able to adapt itself easily to
its image, and in order to compass that end, it was imperative that the
stone presentment should be at least an approximate likeness, and should
reproduce the proportions and peculiarities of the living prototype
for whom it was meant. The head had to be the faithful portrait of the
individual: it was enough for the body to be, so to speak, an average
one, showing him at his fullest development and in the complete
enjoyment of his physical powers. The men were always represented in
their maturity, the women never lost the rounded breast and slight hips
of their girlhood, but a dwarf always preserved his congenital ugliness,
for his salvation in the other world demanded that it should be so. Had
he been given normal stature, the double, accustomed to the deformity of
his members in this world, would have been unable to accommodate himself
to an upright carriage, and would not have been in a fit condition to
resume his course of life.
</p>




<p>
The particular pose of the statue was dependent on the social position
of the person. The king, the nobleman, and the master are always
standing or sitting: it was in these postures they received the homage
of their vassals or relatives. The wife shares her husband's seat,
stands upright beside him, or crouches at his feet as in daily life. The
son, if his statue was ordered while he was a child, wears the dress of
childhood; if he had arrived to manhood, he is represented in the dress
and with the attitude suited to his calling. Slaves grind the grain,
cellarers coat their amphoræ with pitch, bakers knead their dough,
mourners make lamentation and tear their hair. The exigencies of rank
clung to the Egyptians in temple and tomb, wherever their statues were
placed, and left the sculptor who represented them scarcely any liberty.
He might be allowed to vary the details and arrange the accessories
to his taste; he might alter nothing in the attitude or the general
likeness without compromising the end and aim of his work. The statues
of the Memphite period may be counted at the present day by hundreds.
</p>




<p>
Some are in the heavy and barbaric style which has caused them to be
mistaken for primaeval monuments: as, for instance, the statues of Sapi
and his wife, now in the Louvre, which are attributed to the beginning
of the IIIrd dynasty or even earlier. Groups exactly resembling these in
appearance are often found in the tombs of the Vth and VIth dynasties,
which according to this reckoning would be still older than that of
Sapi: they were productions of an inferior studio, and their supposed
archaism is merely the want of skill of an ignorant sculptor. The
majority of the remaining statues are not characterized either by
glaring faults or by striking merits: they constitute an array of
honest good-natured folk, without much individuality of character and
no originality. They may be easily divided into five or six groups, each
having a style in common, and all apparently having been executed on the
lines of a few chosen models; the sculptors who worked for the mastaba
contractors were distributed among a very few studios, in which a
traditional routine was observed for centuries. They did not always
wait for orders, but, like our modern tombstone-makers, kept by them a
tolerable assortment of half-finished statues, from which the purchaser
could choose according to his taste. The hands, feet, and bust lacked
only the colouring and final polish, but the head was merely rough-hewn,
and there were no indications of dress; when the future occupant of
the tomb or his family had made their choice, a few hours of work were
sufficient to transform the rough sketch into a portrait, such as it
was, of the deceased they desired to commemorate, and to arrange his
garment according to the latest fashion. If, however, the relatives or
the sovereign* declined to be satisfied with these commonplace images,
and demanded a less conventional treatment of body for the double of him
whom they had lost, there were always some among the assistants to be
found capable of entering into their wishes, and of seizing the lifelike
expression of limbs and features.
</p>
<pre>
     * It must not be forgotten that the statues were often, like
     the tomb itself, given by the king to the man whose services
     he desired to reward. His burying-place then bore the
     formulary, "By the favour of the king," as I have mentioned
     previously.

We possess at the present day, scattered about in museums, some score of
statues of this period, examples of consummate art,&mdash;the Khephrens, the
Kheops, the Anû, the Nofrît, the Râhotpû I have already mentioned, the
"Sheîkh-el-Beled" and his wife, the sitting scribe of the Louvre and
that of Gîzeh, and the kneeling scribe. Kaâpirû, the "Sheîkh-el-Beled,"
was probably one of the directors of the corvée employed to build the
Great Pyramid.* He seems to be coming forward to meet the beholder, with
an acacia staff in his hand. He has the head and shoulders of a bull,
and a common cast of countenance, whose vulgarity is not wanting in
energy. The large, widely open eye has, by a trick of the sculptor, an
almost uncanny reality about it.
</p>
<pre>
     * It was discovered by Mariette at Saqqâra. "The head,
     torso, arms, and even the staff, were intact; but the
     pedestal and legs were hopelessly decayed, and the statue
     was only kept upright by the sand which surrounded it." The
     staff has since been broken, and is replaced by a more
     recent one exactly like it. In order to set up the figure,
     Mariette was obliged to supply new feet, which retain the
     colour of the fresh wood. By a curious coincidence, Kaâpirû
     was an exact portrait of one of the "Sheikhs el-Beled," or
     mayors of the village of Saqqâra: the Arab workmen, always
     quick to see a likeness, immediately called it the "Sheikh
     el-Beled," and the name has been retained ever since.

The socket which holds it has been hollowed out and filled with an
arrangement of black and white enamel; a rim of bronze marks the outline
of the lids, while a little silver peg, inserted at the back of the
pupil, reflects the light and gives the effect of the sparkle of a
living glance. The statue, which is short in height, is of wood, and one
would be inclined to think that the relative plasticity of the material
counts for something in the boldness of the execution, were it not that
though the sitting scribe of the Louvre is of limestone, the sculptor
has not shown less freedom in its composition. We recognize in this
figure one of those somewhat flabby and heavy subordinate officials of
whom so many examples are to be seen in Oriental courts. He is squatting
cross-legged on the pedestal, pen in hand, with the outstretched leaf of
papyrus conveniently placed on the right: he waits, after an interval
of six thousand years, until Pharaoh or his vizier deigns to resume the
interrupted dictation. His colleague at the Gîzeh Museum awakens in us
no less wonder at his vigour and self-possession; but, being younger,
he exhibits a fuller and firmer figure with a smooth skin, contrasting
strongly with the deeply wrinkled appearance of the other, aggravated as
it is by his flabbiness. The "kneeling scribe" preserves in his pose
and on his countenance that stamp of resigned indecision and monotonous
gentleness which is impressed upon subordinate officials by the
influence of a life spent entirely under the fear of the stick. Banofir,
on the contrary, is a noble lord looking upon his vassals passing in
file before him: his mien is proud, his head disdainful, and he has
that air of haughty indifférence which is befitting a favourite of the
Pharaoh, possessor of generously bestowed sinecures, and lord of a score
of domains. The same haughtiness of attitude distinguishes the
director of the granaries, Nofir. We rarely encounter a small statue
so expressive of vigour and energy. Sometimes there may be found among
these short-garmented people an individual wrapped and almost smothered
in an immense <i>abayah</i>; or a naked man, representing a peasant on his
way to market, his bag on his left shoulder, slightly bent under the
weight, carrying his sandals in his other hand, lest they should be
worn out too quickly in walking. Everywhere we observe the traits of
character distinctive of the individual and his position, rendered
with a scrupulous fidelity: nothing is omitted, no detail of the
characteristics of the model is suppressed. Idealisation we must not
expect, but we have here an intelligent and sometimes too realistic
fidelity. Portraits have been conceived among other peoples and in other
periods in a different way: they have never been better executed.

The decoration of the sepulchres provided employment for scores of
draughtsmen, sculptors, and painters, whose business it was to multiply
in these tombs scenes of everyday life which were indispensable to the
happiness or comfort of the double. The walls are sometimes decorated
with isolated pictures only, each one of which represents a distinct
operation; more frequently we find traced upon them a single subject
whose episodes are superimposed one upon the other from the ground to
the ceiling, and represent an Egyptian panorama from the Nile to the
desert. In the lower portion, boats pass to and fro, and collide with
each other, while the boatmen come to blows with their boat-hooks within
sight of hippopotami and crocodiles. In the upper portions we see a band
of slaves engaged in fowling among the thickets of the river-bank, or
in the making of small boats, the manufacture of ropes, the scraping and
salting of fish. Under the cornice, hunters and dogs drive the gazelle
across the undulating plains of the desert. Every row represents one of
the features of the country; but the artist, instead of arranging the
pictures in perspective, separated them and depicted them one above the
other.

The groups are repeated in one tomb after another; they are always
the same, but sometimes they are reduced to two or three individuals,
sometimes increased in number, spread out and crowded with figures and
inscriptions. Each chief draughtsman had his book of subjects and texts,
which he combined in various ways, at one time bringing them close
together, at another duplicating or extending them according to the
means put at his disposal or the space he had to cover. The same
men, the same animals, the same features of the landscape, the same
accessories, appear everywhere: it is industrial and mechanical art at
its highest. The whole is, however, harmonious, agreeable to the eye,
and instructive. The conventionalisms of the drawing as well as those
of the composition are very different from ours. Whether it is man or
beast, the subject is invariably presented in outline by the brush, or
by the graving tool in sharp relief upon the background; but the animals
are represented in action, with their usual gait, movement, and play of
limbs distinguishing each species. The slow and measured walk of the ox,
the short step, meditative ears, and ironical mouth of the ass, the calm
strength of the lion at rest, the grimaces of the monkeys, the slender
gracefulness of the gazelle and antelope, are invariably presented with
a consummate skill in drawing and expression. The human figure is the
least perfect: every one is acquainted with those strange figures, whose
heads in profile, with the eye drawn in full face, are attached to a
torso seen from the front and supported by limbs in profile. These are
truly anatomical monsters, and yet the appearance they present to us
is neither laughable nor grotesque. The defective limbs are so deftly
connected with those which are normal, that the whole becomes natural:
the correct and fictitious lines are so ingeniously blent together
that they seem to rise necessarily from each other. The actors in these
dramas are constructed in such a paradoxical fashion that they could not
exist in this world of ours; they live notwithstanding, in spite of the
ordinary laws of physiology, and to any one who will take the trouble to
regard them without prejudice, their strangeness will add a charm which
is lacking in works more conformable to nature. A layer of colour spread
over the whole heightens and completes them. This colouring is never
quite true to nature nor yet entirely false. It approaches reality as
far as possible, but without pretending to copy it in a servile way. The
water is always a uniform blue, or broken up by black zigzag lines; the
skin of the men is invariably brown, that of the women pale yellow.
</p>



<p>
The shade befitting each being or object was taught in the workshops,
and once the receipt for it was drawn up, it was never varied in
application. The effect produced by these conventional colours, however,
was neither discordant nor jarring. The most brilliant colours were
placed alongside each other with extreme audacity, but with a perfect
knowledge of their mutual relations and combined effect. They do not
jar with, or exaggerate, or kill each other: they enhance each other's
value, and by their contact give rise to half-shades which harmonize
with them. The sepulchral chapels, in cases where their decoration had
been completed, and where they have reached us intact, appear to us as
chambers hung with beautifully luminous and interesting tapestry, in
which rest ought to be pleasant during the heat of the day to the soul
which dwells within them, and to the friends who come there to hold
intercourse with the dead.
</p>
<p>
The decoration of palaces and houses was not less sumptuous than that of
the sepulchres, but it has been so completely destroyed that we should
find it difficult to form an idea of the furniture of the living if we
did not see it frequently depicted in the abode of the double. The great
armchairs, folding seats, footstools, and beds of carved wood, painted
and inlaid, the vases of hard stone, metal, or enamelled ware, the
necklaces, bracelets, and ornaments on the walls, even the common
pottery of which we find the remains in the neighbourhood of the
pyramids, are generally distinguished by an elegance and grace
reflecting credit on the workmanship and taste of the makers.* The
squares of ivory which they applied to their linen-chests and their
jewel-cases often contained actual bas-reliefs in miniature of as bold
workmanship and as skilful execution as the most beautiful pictures in
the tombs: on these, moreover, were scenes of private life&mdash;dancing or
processions bringing offerings and animals.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The study of the alabaster and diorite vases found near
     the pyramids has furnished Petrie with very ingenious views
     on the methods among the Egyptians of working hard stone.
     Examples of stone toilet or sacrificial bottles are not
     unfrequent in our museums: I may mention those in the Louvre
     which bear the cartouches of Dadkerî Assi (No. 343), of Papi
     I., and of Papi II., the son of Papi I.; not that they are
     to be reckoned among the finest, but because the cartouches
     fix the date of their manufacture. They came from the
     pyramids of these sovereigns, opened by the Arabs at the
     beginning of this century: the vase of the VIth dynasty,
     which is in the Museum at Florence, was brought from Abydos.

     ** M. Grébaut bought at the Great Pyramids, in 1887, a
     series of these ivory sculptures of the Ancient Empire. They
     are now at the Gîzeh Museum. Others belonging to the same
     find are dispersed among private collections: one of them is
     reproduced on p. 249 of this History.

One would like to possess some of those copper and golden statues which
the Pharaoh Kheops consecrated to Isis in honour of his daughter: only
the representation of them upon a stele has come down to us; and the
fragments of sceptres or other objects which too rarely have reached us,
have unfortunately no artistic value.
</p>
<p>
A taste for pretty things was common, at least among the upper classes,
including not only those about the court, but also those in the most
distant nomes of Egypt. The provincial lords, like the courtiers of
the palace, took a pride in collecting around them in the other world
everything of the finest that the art of the architect, sculptor, and
painter could conceive and execute. Their mansions as well as their
temples have disappeared, but we find, here and there on the sides of
the hills, the sepulchres which they had prepared for themselves in
rivalry with those of the courtiers or the members of the reigning
family. They turned the valley into a vast series of catacombs, so that
wherever we look the horizon is bounded by a row of historic tombs.
Thanks to their rock-cut sepulchres, we are beginning to know the
Nomarchs of the Gazelle and the Hare, those of the Serpent-Mountain, of
Akhmîm, Thinis, Qasr-es-Sayad, and Aswan,&mdash;all the scions, in fact, of
that feudal government which preceded the royal sovereignty on the
banks of the Nile, and of which royalty was never able to entirely
disembarrass itself. The Pharaohs of the IVth dynasty had kept them in
such check that we can hardly find any indications during their reigns
of the existence of these great barons; the heads of the Pharaonic
administration were not recruited from among the latter, but from the
family and domestic circle of the sovereign. It was in the time of the
kings of the Vth dynasty, it would appear, that the barons again
entered into favour and gradually gained the upper hand; we find them
in increasing numbers about Anû, Menkaûhorû, and Assi. Did Unas, who was
the last ruler of the dynasty of Elephantine, die without issue, or were
his children prevented from succeeding him by force? The Egyptian annals
of the time of the Ramessides bring the direct line of Menés to an end
with this king. A new line of Memphite origin begins after him.
</p>



<p>
It is almost certain that the transmission of power was not accomplished
without contention, and that there were many claimants to the crown. One
of the latter, Imhotpû, whose legitimacy was always disputed, has
left hardly any traces of his accession to power,* but Ati established
himself firmly on the throne for a year at least:** he pushed on
actively the construction of his pyramid, and sent to the valley of
Hammamât for the stone of his sarcophagus.
</p>
<pre>
     * The monuments furnish proof that their contemporaries
     considered these ephemeral rulers as so many illegitimate
     pretenders. Phtahshopsîsû and his son Sabû-Abibi, who
     exercised important functions at the court, mention only
     Unas and Teti III.; Uni, who took office under Teti III.,
     mentions after this king only Papi I. and Mihtimsaûf I. The
     official succession was, therefore, regulated at this epoch
     in the same way as we afterwards find it in the table of
     Saqqâra, Unas, Teti III., Papi I., Mihtimsaûf I., and in the
     Royal Canon of Turin, without the intercalation of any other
     king.

     ** Brugsch, in his Histoire d'Egypte, pp. 44, 45, had
     identified this king with the first Metesouphis of Manetho:
     E. de Rougé prefers to transfer him to one of the two
     Memphite series after the VIth dynasty, and his opinion has
     been adopted by Wiedemann. The position occupied by his
     inscription among those of Hamraamât has decided me in
     placing him at the end of the Vth or beginning of the VIth
     dynasty: this E. Meyer has also done.
</pre>
<p>
We know not whether revolution or sudden death put an end to his
activity: the "Mastabat-el-Faraun" of Saqqâra, in which he hoped to
rest, never exceeded the height which it has at present.* His name was,
however, inscribed in certain official lists,** and a tradition of the
Greek period maintained that he had been assassinated by his guards.***
Teti III. was the actual founder of the VIth dynasty,**** historians
representing him as having been the immediate successor of Unas.
</p>
<pre>
     * Ati is known only from the Hammamât, inscription dated in
     the first year of his reign. He was identified by Brugsch
     with the Othoes of Manetho, and this identification has been
     generally adopted. M. de Rougé is inclined to attribute to
     him as <i>prænomen</i> the cartouche Usirkeri, which is given in
     the Table of Abydos between those of Teti III. and Papi I.
     Mariette prefers to recognize in Urikeri an independent
     Pharaoh of short reign. Several blocks of the Mastabat-el-
     Faraun at Saqqâra contain the cartouche of Unas, a fact
     which induced Mariette to regard this as the tomb of the
     Pharaoh. The excavations of 1881 showed that Unas was
     entombed elsewhere, and the indications are in favour of
     attributing the mastaba to Ati. We know, indeed, the
     pyramids of Teti III., of the two Papis, and of Metesouphis
     I.; Ati is the only prince of this period with whose tomb we
     are unacquainted. It is thus by elimination, and not by
     direct evidence, that the identification has been arrived
     at: Ati may have drawn upon the workshops of his predecessor
     Unas, which fact would explain the presence on these blocks
     of the cartouche of the latter.

     ** Upon that of Abydos, if we agree with E. de Rougé that
     the cartouche Usirkeri contains his prænomen; upon that
     from which Manetho borrowed, if we admit his identification
     with Othoes.

     *** Manetho (Unger's edition, p. 101), where the form of the
     name is Othoes.

     **** He is called Teti Menephtah, with the cartouche
     prænomen of Seti I., on a monument of the early part of the
     XIXth dynasty, in the Museum at Marseilles: we see him in
     his pyramid represented as standing. This pyramid was opened
     in 1881, and its chambers are covered with long funerary
     inscriptions. It is a work of the time of Seti I., and not a
     contemporary production of the time of Menkaûhorû.
</pre>
<p>
He lived long enough to build at Saqqâra a pyramid whose internal
chambers are covered with inscriptions,* and his son succeeded him
without opposition. Papi I. reigned at least twenty years.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The true pronunciation of this name would be Pipi, and of
     the one before it Titi. The two other Tetis are Teti I. of
     the Ist dynasty, and Zosir-Teti, or Teti II., of the IIIrd.

     ** From fragment 59 of the Royal Canon of Turin, An
     inscription in the quarries of Hât-nûbû bears the date of
     the year 24: if it has been correctly copied, the reign must
     have been four years at least longer than the chronologists
     of the time of the Ramessides thought.

He manifested his activity in all corners of his empire, in the nomes
of the Said as well as in those of the Delta, and his authority extended
beyond the frontiers by which the power of his immediate predecessors
had been limited. He owned sufficient territory south of Elephantine to
regard Nubia as a new kingdom added to those which constituted ancient
Egypt: we therefore see him entitled in his preamble "the triple
Golden Horus," "the triple Conqueror-Horus," "the Delta-Horus," "the
Said-Horus," "the Nubia-Horus." The tribes of the desert furnished him,
as was customary, with recruits for his army, for which he had need
enough, for the Bedouin of the Sinaitic Peninsula were on the move, and
were even becoming dangerous. Papi, aided by Uni, his prime minister,
undertook against them a series of campaigns, in which he reduced them
to a state of helplessness, and extended the sovereignty of Egypt for
the time over regions hitherto unconquered.
</p>
<p>
Uni began his career under Teti.* At first a simple page in the
palace,** he succeeded in obtaining a post in the administration of the
treasury, and afterwards that of inspector of the woods of the royal
domain.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The beginning of the first line is wanting, and I have
     restored it from other inscriptions of the same kind: "I
     was born under Unas." Uni could not have been born before
     Unas; the first office that he filled under Teti III. was
     while he was a child or youth, while the reign of Unas
     lasted thirty years.

     ** Literally, "crown-bearer." This was a title applied
     probably to children who served the king in his private
     apartments, and who wore crowns of natural flowers on their
     heads: the crown was doubtless of the same form as those
     which we see upon the brows of women on several tombs of the
     Memphite epoch.

     *** The word "Khoniti" probably indicates lands with
     plantations of palms or acacias, the thinly wooded forests
     of Egypt, and also of the vines which belonged to the
     personal domain of the Pharaoh.

Papi took him into his friendship at the beginning of his reign, and
conferred upon him the title of "friend," and the office of head of
the cabinet, in which position he acquitted himself with credit. Alone,
without other help than that of a subordinate scribe, he transacted all
the business and drew up all the documents connected with the harem and
the privy council. He obtained an ample reward for his services. Pharaoh
granted to him, as a proof of his complete satisfaction, the furniture
of a tomb in choice white limestone; one of the officials of the
necropolis was sent to obtain from the quarries at Troiû the blocks
required, and brought back with him a sarcophagus and its lid, a
door-shaped stele with its setting and a table of offerings. He affirms
with much self-satisfaction that never before had such a thing happened
to any one; moreover, he adds, "my wisdom charmed his Majesty, my zeal
pleased him, and his Majesty's heart was delighted with me." All this
is pure hyperbole, but no one was surprised at it in Egypt; etiquette
required that a faithful subject should declare the favours of his
sovereign to be something new and unprecedented, even when they
presented nothing extraordinary or out of the common. Gifts of
sepulchral furniture were of frequent occurrence, and we know of more
than one instance of them previous to the VIth dynasty&mdash;for example,
the case of the physician Sokhît-niônkhû, whose tomb still exists at
Saqqâra, and whom Pharaoh Sahurî rewarded by presenting him with a
monumental stele in stone from Turah. Henceforth Uni could face without
apprehension the future which awaited him in the other world; at the
same time, he continued to make his way no less quickly in this, and was
soon afterwards promoted to the rank of "sole friend" and superintendent
of the irrigated lands of the king. The "sole friends" were closely
attached to the person of their master. In all ceremonies, their
appointed place was immediately behind him, a place of the highest
honour and trust, for those who occupied it literally held his life
in their hands. They made all the arrangements for his processions and
journeys, and saw that the proper ceremonial was everywhere observed,
and that no accident was allowed to interrupt the progress of his train.
Lastly, they had to take care that none of the nobles ever departed from
the precise position to which his birth or office entitled him. This was
a task which required a great deal of tact, for questions of precedence
gave rise to nearly as many heart-burnings in Egypt as in modern courts.
Uni acquitted himself so dexterously, that he was called upon to act
in a still more delicate capacity. Queen Amîtsi was the king's chief
consort. Whether she had dabbled in some intrigue of the palace, or had
been guilty of unfaithfulness in act or in intention, or had been mixed
up in one of those feminine dramas which so frequently disturb the peace
of harems, we do not know. At any rate, Papi considered it necessary to
proceed against her, and appointed Uni to judge the case. Aided only
by his secretary, he drew up the indictment and decided the action so
discreetly, that to this day we do not know of what crime Amîtsi was
accused or how the matter ended. Uni felt great pride at having been
preferred before all others for this affair, and not without reason,
"for," says he, "my duties were to superintend the royal forests, and
never before me had a man in my position been initiated into the secrets
of the Royal Harem; but his Majesty initiated me into them because my
wisdom pleased his Majesty more than that of any other of his lieges,
more than that of any other of his mamelukes, more than that of any
other of his servants." These antecedents did not seem calculated to
mark out Uni as a future minister of war; but in the East, when a man
has given proofs of his ability in one branch of administration, there
is a tendency to consider him equally well fitted for service in any
of the others, and the fiat of a prince transforms the clever scribe of
to-day into the general of to-morrow. No one is surprised, not even
the person promoted; he accepts his new duties without flinching, and
frequently distinguishes himself as much in their performance as though
he had been bred to them from his youth up. When Papi had resolved to
give a lesson to the Bedouin of Sinai, he at once thought of Uni, his
"sole friend," who had so skilfully conducted the case of Queen
Amîtsi. The expedition was not one of those which could be brought to
a successful issue by the troops of the frontier nomes; it required a
considerable force, and the whole military organization of the country
had to be brought into play. "His Majesty raised troops to the number of
several myriads, in the whole of the south from Elephantine to the nome
of the Haunch, in the Delta, in the two halves of the valley, in each
fort of the forts of the desert, in the land of Iritît, among the blacks
of the land of Maza, among the blacks of the land of Amamît, among the
blacks of the land of Ûaûait, among the blacks of the land of Kaaû,
among the blacks of To-Tamû, and his Majesty sent me at the head of this
army. It is true, there were chiefs there, there were mamelukes of the
king there, there were sole friends of the Great House there, there
were princes and governors of castles from the south and from the north,
'gilded friends,' directors of the prophets from the south and the
north, directors of districts at the head of troops from the south and
the north, of castles and towns that each one ruled, and also blacks
from the regions which I have mentioned, but it was I who gave them
their orders&mdash;although my post was only that of superintendent of the
irrigated lands of Pharaoh,&mdash;so much so that every one of them obeyed
me like the others." It was not without much difficulty that he brought
this motley crowd into order, equipped them, and supplied them with
rations. At length he succeeded in arranging everything satisfactorily;
by dint of patience and perseverance, "each one took his biscuit and
sandals for the march, and each one of them took bread from the towns,
and each one of them took goats from the peasants." He collected his
forces on the frontier of the Delta, in the "Isle of the North," between
the "Gate of Imhotpû" and the "Tell of Horû nib-mâît," and set out into
the desert. He advanced, probably by Gebel Magharah and Gebel Helal,
as far as Wady-el-Arîsh, into the rich and populous country which lay
between the southern slopes of Gebel Tîh and the south of the Dead Sea:
once there he acted with all the rigour permitted by the articles of
war, and paid back with interest the ill usage which the Bedouin had
inflicted on Egypt. "This army came in peace, it completely destroyed
the country of the Lords of the Sands. This army came in peace, it
pulverized the country of the Lords of the Sands. This army came in
peace, it demolished their 'douars.' This army came in peace, it cut
down their fig trees and their vines. This army came in peace, it burnt
the houses of all their people. This army came in peace, it slaughtered
their troops to the numbers of many myriads. This army came in peace, it
brought back great numbers of their people as living captives, for which
thing his Majesty praised me more than for aught else."* As a matter of
fact, these poor wretches were sent off as soon as taken to the quarries
or to the dockyards, thus relieving the king from the necessity of
imposing compulsory labour too frequently on his Egyptian subjects.
</p>
<pre>
     * The locality of the tribes against which Uni waged war
     can, I think, be fixed by certain details of the campaign,
     especially the mention of the oval or circular enclosures
     "ûanît" within which they entrenched themselves. These
     enclosures, or ndars, correspond to the nadami which are
     mentioned by travellers in these regions, and which are
     singularly characteristic. The "Lords of the Sands"
     mentioned by Uni occupied the naûami country, i.e. the Negeb
     regions situated on the edge of the desert of Tih, round
     about Aîn-Qadis, and beyond it as far as Akabah and the Dead
     Sea. Assuming this hypothesis to be correct, the route
     followed by Uni must have been the same as that which was
     discovered and described nearly twenty years ago, by
     Holland.

"His Majesty sent me five times to lead this army in order to penetrate
into the country of the Lords of the Sands, on each occasion of their
revolt against this army, and I bore myself so well that his Majesty
praised me beyond everything." The Bedouin at length submitted, but
the neighbouring tribes to the north of them, who had no doubt assisted
them, threatened to dispute with Egypt the possession of the territory
which it had just conquered. As these tribes had a seaboard on the
Mediterranean, Uni decided to attack them by sea, and got together a
fleet in which he embarked his army. The troops landed on the coast of
the district of Tiba, to the north of the country of the Lords of the
Sands, thereupon "they set out. I went, I smote all the barbarians, and
I killed all those of them who resisted." On his return, Uni obtained
the most distinguished marks of favour that a subject could receive,
the right to carry a staff and to wear his sandals in the palace in the
presence of Pharaoh.

These wars had occupied the latter part of the reign; the last of them
took place very shortly before the death of the sovereign. The domestic
administration of Papi I. seems to have been as successful in its
results, as was his activity abroad. He successfully worked the mines
of Sinai, caused them to be regularly inspected, and obtained an unusual
quantity of minerals from them; the expedition he sent thither, in the
eighteenth year of his reign, left behind it a bas-relief in which are
recorded the victories of Uni over the barbarians and the grants
of territory made to the goddess Hâthor. Work was carried on
uninterruptedly at the quarries of Hatnûbû and Kohanû; building
operations were carried on at Memphis, where the pyramid was in course
of erection, at Abydos, whither the oracle of Osiris was already
attracting large numbers of pilgrims, at Tanis, at Bubastis, and
at Heliopolis. The temple of Dendera was falling into ruins; it was
restored on the lines I of the original plans which were accidentally
discovered, and this piety displayed towards one of the most honoured
deities was rewarded, as it deserved to be, by the insertion of the
title of "son of Hâthor" in the royal cartouche. The vassals rivalled
their sovereign in activity, and built new towns on all sides to serve
them as residences, more than one of which was named after the Pharaoh.
The death of Papi I. did nothing to interrupt this movement; the elder
of his two sons by his second wife, Mirirî-ônkhnas, succeeded him
without opposition. Mirnirî Mihtimsaûf I. (Metesouphis) was almost a
child when he ascended the throne. The recently conquered Bedouin gave
him no trouble; the memory of their reverses was still too recent to
encourage them to take advantage of his minority and renew hostilities.
Uni, moreover, was at hand, ready to recommence his campaigns at the
slightest provocation. Metesouphis had retained him in all his offices,
and had even entrusted him with new duties. "Pharaoh appointed me
governor-general of Upper Egypt, from Elephantine in the south to
Letopolis in the north, because my wisdom was pleasing to his Majesty,
because my zeal was pleasing to his Majesty, because the heart of his
Majesty was satisfied with me.... When I was in my place I was above all
his vassals, all his mamelukes, and all his servants, for never had
so great a dignity been previously conferred upon a mere subject. I
fulfilled to the satisfaction of the king my office as superintendent of
the South, so satisfactorily, that it was granted to me to be second in
rank to him, accomplishing all the duties of a superintendent of works,
judging all the cases which the royal administration had to judge in
the south of Egypt as second judge, to render judgment at all hours
determined by the royal administration in this south of Egypt as second
judge, transacting as a governor all the business there was to do in
this south of Egypt." The honour of fetching the hard stone blocks
intended for the king's pyramid fell to him by right: he proceeded to
the quarries of Abhaît, opposite Sehel, to select the granite for
the royal sarcophagus and its cover, and to those of Hatnûbû for the
alabaster for the table of offerings. The transport of the table was a
matter of considerable difficulty, for the Nile was low, and the stone
of colossal size: Uni constructed on the spot a raft to carry it, and
brought it promptly to Saqqâra in spite of the sandbanks which obstruct
navigation when the river is low.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Prof. Petrie has tried to prove from the passage which
     relates to the transport, that the date of the reign of Papi
     I. must have been within sixty years of 3240 B.C.; this date
     I believe to be at least four centuries too late. It is,
     perhaps, to this voyage of Uni that the inscription of the
     Vth year of Metesouphis I. refers, given by Blackden-Frazer
     in A Collection of Hieratic Graffiti from the Alabaster
     Quarry of Rat-nub, pl. xv. 2.
</pre>
<p>
This was not the limit of his enterprise: the Pharaohs had not as yet a
fleet in Nubia, and even if they had had, the condition of the channel
was such as to prevent it from making the passage of the cataract.
He demanded acacia-wood from the tribes of the desert, the peoples
of Iritit and Uaûaît, and from the Mâzaiû, laid down his ships on the
stocks, built three galleys and two large lighters in a single year;
during this time the river-side labourers had cleared five channels
through which the flotilla passed and made its way to Memphis with
its ballast of granite. This was Uni's last exploit; he died shortly
afterwards, and was buried in the cemetery at Abydos, in the sarcophagus
which had been given him by Papi I.
</p>


<p>
Was it solely to obtain materials for building the pyramid that he
had re-established communication by water between Egypt and Nubia? The
Egyptians were gaining ground in the south every day, and under their
rule the town of Elephantine was fast becoming a depot for trade with
the Soudan.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The growing importance of Elephantine is shown by the
     dimensions of the tombs which its princes had built for
     themselves, as well as by the number of graffiti
     commemorating the visits of princes and functionaries, and
     still remaining at the present day.
</pre>
<p>
The town occupied only the smaller half of a long narrow island, which
was composed of detached masses of granite, formed gradually into a
compact whole by accumulations of sand, and over which the Nile, from
time immemorial, had deposited a thick coating of its mud. It is now
shaded by acacias, mulberry trees, date trees, and dôm palms, growing in
some places in lines along the pathways, in others distributed in groups
among the fields. Half a dozen saqiyehs, ranged in a line along the
river-bank, raise water day and night, with scarcely any cessation of
their monotonous creaking. The inhabitants do not allow a foot of their
narrow domain to lie idle; they have cultivated wherever it is possible
small plots of durra and barley, bersim and beds of vegetables.

A few scattered buffaloes and cows graze in corners, while fowls and

they can pick up. It is a world in miniature, tranquil and pleasant,
where life is passed without effort, in a perpetually clear atmosphere
and in the shade of trees which never lose their leaf. The ancient city
was crowded into the southern extremity, on a high plateau of granite
beyond the reach of inundations. Its ruins, occupying a space half a
mile in circumference, are heaped around a shattered temple of Khnûrnû,
of which the most ancient parts do not date back beyond the sixteenth
century before our era.

It was surrounded with walls, and a fortress of sun-dried brick perched
upon a neighbouring island to the south-west, gave it complete com-mand
over the passages of the cataract. An arm of the river ninety yards wide
separated it from Sûanît, whose closely built habitations were
ranged along the steep bank, and formed, as it were, a suburb. Marshy
pasturages occupied the modern site of Syene; beyond these were gardens,
vines, furnishing wine celebrated throughout the whole of Egypt, and a
forest of date palms running towards the north along the banks of the
stream. The princes of the nome of Nubia encamped here, so to speak,
as frontier-posts of civilization, and maintained frequent but variable
relations with the people of the desert. It gave the former no trouble
to throw, as occasion demanded it, bodies of troops on the right or left
sides of the valley, in the direction of the Red Sea or in that of the
Oasis; however little they might carry away in their raids&mdash;of oxen,
slaves, wood, charcoal, gold dust, amethysts, cornelian or green felspar
for the manufacture of ornaments&mdash;it was always so much to the good, and
the treasury of the prince profited by it. They never went very far in
their expeditions: if they desired to strike a blow at a distance,
to reach, for example, those regions of Pûanît of whose riches the
barbarians were wont to boast, the aridity of the district around the
second cataract would arrest the advance of their foot-soldiers, while
the rapids of Wady Haifa would offer an almost impassable barrier to
their ships. In such distant operations they did not have recourse to
arms, but disguised themselves as peaceful merchants. An easy road led
almost direct from their capital to Ras Banât, which they called the
"Head of Nekhabît," on the Red Sea; arrived at the spot where in later
times stood one of the numerous Berenices, and having quickly put
together a boat from the wood of the neighbouring forest, they made
voyages along the coast, as far as the Sinaitic peninsula and the
Hirû-Shâîtû on the north, as well as to the land of Pûânît itself on
the south. The small size of these improvised vessels rendered such
expeditions dangerous, while it limited their gain; they preferred,
therefore, for the most part the land journey.

It was fatiguing and interminable: donkeys&mdash;the only beast of burden
they were acquainted with, or, at least, employed&mdash;could make but short
stages, and they spent months upon months in passing through countries
which a caravan of camels would now traverse in a few weeks.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The <i>History of the Peasant</i>, in the Berlin Papyri Nos.
     ii. and iv., affords us a good example of the use made of
     pack-asses; the hero was on his way across the desert, from
     the "Wady Natrûn" to Henasieh, with a quantity of merchandise
     which he intended to sell, when an unscrupulous artisan,
     under cover of a plausible pretext, stole his train of pack-
     asses and their loads. Hirkhûf brought back with him a
     caravan of three hundred asses from one of his journeys; cf.
     p. 278 of the present work.
</pre>
<p>
The roads upon which they ventured were those which, owing to the
necessity for the frequent watering of the donkeys and the impossibility
of carrying with them adequate supplies of water, were marked out at
frequent intervals by wells and springs, and were therefore necessarily
of a tortuous and devious character. Their choice of objects for barter
was determined by the smallness of their bulk and weight in comparison
with their value. The Egyptians on the one side were provided with
stocks of beads, ornaments, coarse cutlery, strong perfumes, and rolls
of white or coloured cloth, which, after the lapse of thirty-five
centuries, are objects still coveted by the peoples of Africa. The
aborigines paid for these articles of small value, in gold, either
in dust or in bars, in ostrich feathers, lions' and leopards' skins,
elephants' tusks, cowrie shells, billets of ebony, incense, and gum
arabic. Considerable value was attached to cynocephali and green
monkeys, with which the kings or the nobles amused themselves, and which
they were accustomed to fasten to the legs of their chairs on days of
solemn reception; but the dwarf, the Danga, was the rare commodity which
was always in demand, but hardly ever attainable.*

Partly by commerce, and partly by pillage, the lords of Elephantine
became rapidly wealthy, and began to play an important part among the
nobles of the Said: they were soon obliged to take serious precautions
against the cupidity which their wealth excited among the tribes of
Konusît. They entrenched themselves behind a wall of sun-dried brick,
some seven and a half miles long, of which the ruins are still an object
of wonder to the traveller. It was flanked towards the north by the
ramparts of Syene, and followed pretty regularly the lower course of the
valley to its abutment at the port of Mahatta opposite Philas: guards
distributed along it, kept an eye upon the mountain, and uttered a
call to arms, when the enemy came within sight. Behind this bulwark
the population felt quite at ease, and could work without fear at the
granite quarries on behalf of the Pharaoh, or pursue in security their
callings of fishermen and sailors. The inhabitants of the village of
Satît and of the neighbouring islands claimed from earliest times the
privilege of piloting the ships which went up and down the rapids,
and of keeping clear the passages which were used for navigation.
They worked under the protection of their goddesses Anûkît and Satît:
travellers of position were accustomed to sacrifice in the temple of the
goddesses at Sehêl, and to cut on the rock votive inscriptions in their
honour, in gratitude for the prosperous voyage accorded to them. We meet
their scrawls on every side, at the entrance and exit of the cataract,
and on the small islands where they moored their boats at nightfall
during the four or five days required for the passage; the bank of
the stream between Elephantine and Philæ is, as it were, an immense
visitors' book, in which every generation of Ancient Egypt has in turn
inscribed itself. The markets and streets of the twin cities must have
presented at that time the same motley blending of types and costumes
which we might have found some years back in the bazaars of modern
Syene. Nubians, negroes of the Soudan, perhaps people from Southern
Arabia, jostled there with Libyans and Egyptians of the Delta. What the
princes did to make the sojourn of strangers agreeable, what temples
they consecrated to their god Khnûmû and his companions, in gratitude
for the good things he had bestowed upon them, we have no means of
knowing up to the present. Elephantine and Syene have preserved for us
nothing of their ancient edifices; but the tombs which they have left
tell us their history. They honeycomb in long lines the sides of the
steep hill which looks down upon the whole extent of the left bank of
the Nile opposite the narrow channel of the port of Aswan. A rude flight
of stone steps led from the bank to the level of the sepulchres. The
mummy having been carried slowly on the shoulders of the bearers to the
platform, was deposited for a moment at the entrance cf the chapel.
The decoration of the latter was rather meagre, and was distinguished
neither by the delicacy of its execution nor by the variety of the
subjects. More care was bestowed upon the exterior, and upon the walls
on each side of the door, which could be seen from the river or from the
streets of Elephantine. An inscription borders the recess, and boasts
to every visitor of the character of the occupant: the portrait of the
deceased, and sometimes that of his son, stand to the right and left:
the scenes devoted to the offerings come next, when an artist of
sufficient skill could be found to engrave them.

The expeditions of the lords of Elephantine, crowned as they frequently
were with success, soon attracted the attention of the Pharaohs:
Metesouphis deigned to receive in person at the cataract the homage of
the chiefs of Ûaûaît and Iritît and of the Màzaiû during the early days
of the fifth year of his reign.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The words used in the inscription, "The king himself went
     and returned, ascending the mountain to see what there was
     on the mountain," prove that Metesouphis inspected the
     quarries in person. Another inscription, discovered in 1893,
     gives the year V. as the date of his journey to Elephantine,
     and adds that he had negotiations with the heads of the four
     great Nubian races.
</pre>
<p>
The most celebrated caravan guide at this time was Hirkhûf, own cousin
to Mikhû, Prince of Elephantine. He had entered upon office under the
auspices of his father Iri, "the sole friend." A king whose name he does
not mention, but who was perhaps Unas, more probably Papi I., despatched
them both to the country of the Amamît. The voyage occupied seven
months, and was extraordinarily successful: the sovereign, encouraged by
this unexpected good fortune, resolved to send out a fresh expedition.
Hirkhûf had the sole command of it; he made his way through Iritît,
explored the districts of Satir and Darros, and retraced his steps
after an absence of eight months. He brought back with him a quantity
of valuable commodities, "the like of which no one had ever previously
brought back." He was not inclined to regain his country by the ordinary
route: he pushed boldly into the narrow wadys which furrow the territory
of the people of Iritît, and emerged upon the region of Situ, in the
neighbourhood of the cataract, by paths in which no official traveller
who had visited the Amamît had up to this time dared to travel. A third
expedition which started out a few years later brought him into regions
still less frequented. It set out by the Oasis route, proceeded towards
the Amamît, and found the country in an uproar. The sheikhs had convoked
their tribes, and were making preparations to attack the Timihû "towards
the west corner of the heaven," in that region where stand the pillars
which support the iron firmament at the setting sun. The Timihû were
probably Berbers by race and language. Their tribes, coming from beyond
the Sahara, wandered across the frightful solitudes which bound the Nile
Valley on the west. The Egyptians had constantly to keep a sharp look
out for them, and to take precautions against their incursions; having
for a long time acted only on the defensive, they at length took the
offensive, and decided, not without religious misgivings, to pursue
them to their retreats. As the inhabitants of Mendes and of Busiris
had relegated the abode of their departed to the recesses of the
impenetrable marshes of the Delta, so those of Siût and Thinis had at
first believed that the souls of the deceased sought a home beyond the
sands: the good jackal Anubis acted as their guide, through the gorge
of the Cleft or through the gate of the Oven, to the green islands
scattered over the desert, where the blessed dwelt in peace at a
convenient distance from their native cities and their tombs. They
constituted, as we know, a singular folk, those <i>uiti</i> whose members
dwelt in coffins, and who had put on the swaddling clothes of the dead;
the Egyptians called the Oasis which they had colonised, the land of the
shrouded, or of mummies, <i>ûît</i>, and the name continued to designate
it long after the advance of geographical knowledge had removed this
paradise further towards the west. The Oases fell one after the other
into the hands of frontier princes&mdash;that of Bahnesa coming under the
dominion of the lord of Oxyrrhynchus, that of Dakhel under the lords of
Thinis. The Nubians of Amamît had relations, probably, with the Timihû,
who owned the Oasis of Dush&mdash;a prolongation of that of Dakhel, on the
parallel of Elephantine. Hirkhûf accompanied the expedition to the
Amamît, succeeded in establishing peace among the rival tribes, and
persuaded them "to worship all the gods of Pharaoh:" he afterwards
reconciled the Iritît, Amamît, and Ûaûaît, who lived in a state of
perpetual hostility to each other, explored their valleys, and collected
from them such quantities of incense, ebony, ivory, and skins that three
hundred asses were required for their transport.

He was even fortunate enough to acquire a Danga from the land of ghosts,
resembling the one brought from Pûanît by Biûrdidi in the reign of Assi
eighty years before. Metesouphis, in the mean time, had died, and his
young brother and successor, Papi II., had already been a year upon the
throne. The new king, delighted to possess a dwarf who could perform
"the dance of the god," addressed a rescript to Hirkhuf to express his
satisfaction; at the same time he sent him a special messenger, Uni, a
distant relative to Papi I.'s minister, who was to invite him to come
and give an account of his expedition. The boat in which the explorer
embarked to go down to Memphis, also brought the Danga, and from that
moment the latter became the most important personage of the party. For
him all the royal officials, lords, and sacerdotal colleges hastened to
prepare provisions and means of conveyance; his health was of greater
importance than that of his protector, and he was anxiously watched
lest he should escape. "When he is with thee in the boat, let there be
cautious persons about him, lest he should fall into the water; when he
rests during the night, let careful people sleep beside him, in case of
his escaping quickly in the night-time. For my Majesty desires to see
this dwarf more than all the treasures which are being imported from
the land of Pûanît." Hirkhûf, on his return to Elephantine, engraved the
royal letter and the detailed account of his journeys to the lands of
the south, on the façade of his tomb.

These repeated expeditions produced in course of time more important
and permanent results than the capture of an accomplished dwarf, or the
acquisition of a fortune by an adventurous nobleman. The nations which
these merchants visited were accustomed to hear so much of Egypt, its
industries, and its military force, that they came at last to entertain
an admiration and respect for her, not unmingled with fear: they learned
to look upon her as a power superior to all others, and upon her king as
a god whom none might resist. They adopted Egyptian worship, yielded to
Egypt their homage, and sent the Egyptians presents: they were won over
by civilization before being subdued by arms. We are not acquainted
with the manner in which Nofirkiri-Papi II. turned these friendly
dispositions to good account in extending his empire to the south. The
expeditions did not all prove so successful as that of Hirkhûf, and one
at least of the princes of Elephantine, Papinakhîti, met with his death
in the course of one of them. Papi II. had sent him on a mission, after
several others, "to make profit out of the Ûaûaiû and the Iritît." He
killed considerable numbers in this raid, and brought back great spoil,
which he shared with Pharaoh; "for he was at the head of many warriors,
chosen from among the bravest," which was the cause of his success in
the enterprise with which his Holiness had deigned to entrust him. Once,
however, the king employed him in regions which were not so familiar to
him as those of Nubia, and fate was against him. He had received orders
to visit the Amu, the Asiatic tribes inhabiting the Sinaitic Peninsula,
and to repeat on a smaller scale in the south the expedition which Uni
had led against them in the north; he proceeded thither, and his sojourn
having come to an end, he chose to return by sea. To sail towards
Pûanît, to coast up as far as the "Head of Nekhabît," to land there
and make straight for Elephantine by the shortest route, presented no
unusual difficulties, and doubtless more than one traveller or general
of those times had safely accomplished it; Papinakhîti failed miserably.
As he was engaged in constructing his vessel, the Hirû-Shâîtû fell
upon him and massacred him, as well as the detachment of troops who
accompanied him: the remaining soldiers brought home his body, which was
buried by the side of the other princes in the mountain opposite Syene.
Papi II. had ample leisure to avenge the death of his vassal and to
send fresh expeditions to Iritît, among the Amamît and even beyond, if,
indeed, as the author of the chronological Canon of Turin asserts,* he
really reigned for more than ninety years; but the monuments are almost
silent with regard to him, and give us no information about his possible
exploits in Nubia. An inscription of his second year proves that he
continued to work the Sinaitic mines, and that he protected them from
the Bedouin.
</p>
<pre>
     * The fragments of Manetho and the Canon of Eratosthenes
     agree in assigning to him a reign of a hundred years&mdash;a fact
     which seems to indicate that the missing unit in the Turin
     list was nine: Papi II. would have thus died in the hundreth
     year of his reign. A reign of a hundred years is impossible:
     Mihtimsaûf I. having reigned fourteen years, it would be
     necessary to assume that Papi II., son of Papi I., should
     have lived a hundred and fourteen years at the least, even
     on the supposition that he was a posthumous child. The
     simplest solution is to suppose (1) that Papi II. lived a
     hundred years, as Ramses II. did in later times, and that
     the years of his life were confounded with the years of his
     reign; or (2) that, being the brother of Mihtimsaûf I., he
     was considered as associated with him on the throne, and
     that the hundred years of his reign, including the fourteen
     of the latter prince, were identified with the years of his
     life. We may, moreover, believe that the chronologists, for.
     lack of information on the VIth dynasty, have filled the
     blanks in their annals by lengthening the reign of Papi II.,
     which in any case must have been very long.
</pre>
<p>
On the other hand, the number and beauty of the tombs in which mention
is made of him, bear witness to the fact that Egypt enjoyed continued
prosperity. Recent discoveries have done much to surround this king and
his immediate predecessors with an air of reality which is lacking in
many of the later Pharaohs.

Their pyramids, whose familiar designations we have deciphered in the
texts, have been uncovered at Saqqâra, and the inscriptions which they
contain, reveal to us the names of the sovereigns who reposed within.
Unas, Teti III., Papi I., Mete-souphis I., and Papi II. now have as
clearly defined a personality for us as Ramses II. or Seti I.; even the
mummy of Metesouphis has been discovered near his sarcophagus, and can
be seen under glass in the Gîzeh Museum. The body is thin and slender;
the head refined, and ornamented with the thick side-lock of boyhood;
the features can be easily distinguished, although the lower jaw has
disappeared and the pressure of the bandages has flattened the nose.
All the pyramids of the dynasty are of a uniform-type, the model being
furnished by that of Unas. The entrance is in the centre of the northern
façade, underneath the lowest course, and on the ground-level.
An inclined passage, obstructed by enormous stones, leads to an
antechamber, whose walls are partly bare, and partly covered with long
columns of hieroglyphs: a level passage, blocked towards the middle by
three granite barrier, ends in a nearly square chamber; on the left are
three low cells devoid of ornament, and on the right an oblong chamber
containing the sarcophagus.

These two principal rooms had high-pitched roofs. They were composed of
large slabs of limestone, the upper edges of which leaned one against
the other, while the lower edges rested on a continuous ledge which ran
round the chamber: the first row of slabs was surmounted by a second,
and that again by a third, and the three together effectively protected
the apartments of the dead against the thrust of the superincumbent
mass, or from the attacks of robbers. The wall-surfaces close to the
sarcophagus in the pyramid of Unas are decorated with many-coloured
ornaments and sculptured and painted doors representing the front of
a house: this was, in fact, the dwelling of the double, in which he
resided with the dead body.

The inscriptions, like the pictures in the tombs, were meant to furnish
the sovereign with provisions, to dispel serpents and malevolent
divinities, to keep his soul from death, and to lead him into the bark
of the sun or into the Paradise of Osiris. They constitute a portion of
a vast book, whose chapters are found scattered over the monuments of
subsequent periods. They are the means of restoring to us, not only the
religion but the most ancient language of Egypt: the majority of the
formulas contained in them were drawn up in the time of the earliest
human kings, perhaps even before Menés.

The history of the VIth dynasty loses itself in legend and fable.
Two more kings are supposed to have succeeded Papi Nofirkeri, Mirnirî
Mihtimsaût (Metesouphis II.) and Nîtaûqrît (Nitokris). Metesouphis II.
was killed, so runs the tale, in a riot, a year after his accession.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Manetho does not mention this fact, but the legend given
     by Herodotus says that Nitokris wished to avenge the king,
     her brother and predecessor, who was killed in a revolution;
     and it follows from the narrative of the facts that this
     anonymous brother was the Metesouphis of Manetho. The Turin
     Papyrus assigns a reign of a year and a month to Mihtimsaul-
     Metesouphis II.
</pre>
<p>
His sister, Nitokris, the "rosy-cheeked," to whom, as was the custom, he
was married, succeeded him and avenged his death. She built an immense
subterranean hall; under pretext of inaugurating its completion, but in
reality with a totally different aim, she then invited to a great feast,
and received in this hall, a considerable number of Egyptians from among
those whom she knew to have been instigators of the crime. During the
entertainment, she diverted the waters of the Nile into the hall by means
of a canal which she had kept concealed. This is what is related of her.
They add, that "after this, the queen, of her own will, threw herself
into a great chamber filled with ashes, in order to escape punishment."
She completed the pyramid of Mykerinos, by adding to it that costly
casing of Syenite which excited the admiration of travellers; she
reposed in a sarcophagus of blue basalt, in the very centre of the
monument, above the secret chamber where the pious Pharaoh had hidden
his mummy.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The legend which ascribes the building of the third
     pyramid to a woman has been preserved by Herodotus: E. de
     Bunsen, comparing it with the observations of Vyse, was
     inclined to attribute to Nitokris the enlarging of the
     monument, which appears to me to have been the work of
     Mykerinos himself.
</pre>
<p>
The Greeks, who had heard from their dragomans the story of the
"Rosy-cheeked Beauty," metamorphosed the princess into a courtesan,
and for the name of Nitokris, substituted the more harmonious one of
Rhodopis, which was the exact translation of the characteristic epithet
of the Egyptian queen. One day while she was bathing in the river, an
eagle stole one of her gilded sandals, carried it off in the
direction of Memphis, and let it drop in the lap of the king, who was
administering justice in the open air. The king, astonished at the
singular occurrence, and at the beauty of the tiny shoe, caused a search
to be made throughout the country for the woman to whom it belonged:
Rhodopis thus became Queen of Egypt, and could build herself a pyramid.
Even Christianity and the Arab conquest did not entirely efface the
remembrance of the courtesan-princess.

It is said that the spirit of the Southern Pyramid never appears abroad,
except in the form of a naked woman, who is very beautiful, but whose
manner of acting is such, that when she desires to make people fall
in love with her, and lose their wits, she smiles upon them, and
immediately they draw near to her, and she attracts them towards her,
and makes them infatuated with love; so that they at once lose their
wits, and wander aimlessly about the country. Many have seen her moving
round the pyramid about midday and towards sunset. It is Nitokris still
haunting the monument of her shame and her magnificence.*

After her, even tradition is silent, and the history of Egypt remains
a mere blank for several centuries. Manetho admits the existence of
two other Memphite dynasties, of which the first contains seventy kings
during as many days. Akhthoës, the most cruel of tyrants, followed next,
and oppressed his subjects for a long period: he was at last the victim
of raving madness, and met with his death from the jaws of a crocodile.
It is related that he was of Heracleopolite extraction, and the
two dynasties which succeeded him, the IXth and the Xth, were also
Heracleopolitan. The table of Abydos is incomplete, and the Turin
Papyrus, in the absence of other documents, too mutilated to furnish
us with any exact information; the contemporaries of the Ptolemies were
almost entirely ignorant of what took place between the end of the VIth
and the beginning of the XIIth dynasty; and Egyptologists, not finding
any monuments which they could attribute to this period, thereupon
concluded that Egypt had passed through some formidable crisis out of
which she with difficulty extricated herself.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Marsham (<i>Canon Chronicus</i>, edition, of Leipzig, 1676, p.
     29) had already declared in the seventeenth century that he
     felt no hesitation in considering the Heracleopolites as
     identical with the successors of Menes-Misraîm, who reigned
     over the Mestraea, that is, over the Delta only. The idea of
     an Asiatic invasion, analogous to that of the Hyksos, which
     was put forward by Mariette, and accepted by Fr. Lenormant,
     has found its chief supporters in Germany. Bunsen made of
     the Heracleopolitan two subordinate dynasties reigning
     simultaneously in Lower Egypt, and originating at
     Heracleopolis in the Delta: they were supposed to have been
     contemporaries of the last Memphite and first Theban
     dynasties. Lepsius accepted and recognized in the
     Heracleopolitans of the Delta the predecessors of the
     Hyksos, an idea defended by Ebers, and developed by Krall in
     his identification of the unknown invaders with the Hirû-
     Shâîtû: it has been adopted by Ed. Meyer, and by Petrie.
</pre>
<p>
The so-called Heracleopolites of Manetho were assumed to have been the
chiefs of a barbaric people of Asiatic origin, those same "Lords of the
Sands" so roughly handled by Uni, but who are considered to have invaded
the Delta soon after, settled themselves in Heracleopolis Parva as their
capital, and from thence held sway over the whole valley. They appeared
to have destroyed much and built nothing; the state of barbarism into
which they sank, and to which they reduced the vanquished, explaining
the absence of any monuments to mark their occupation. This hypothesis,
however, is unsupported by any direct proof: even the dearth of
monuments which has been cited as an argument in favour of the
theory, is no longer a fact. The sequence of reigns and details of the
revolutions are wanting; but many of the kings and certain facts in
their history are known, and we are able to catch a glimpse of the
general course of events. The VIIth and VIIIth dynasties are Memphite,
and the names of the kings themselves would be evidence in favour of
their genuineness, even if we had not the direct testimony of Manetho:
the one recurring most frequently is that of Nofirkerî, the prenomen of
Papi II., and a third Papi figures in them, who calls himself Papi-Sonbû
to distinguish himself from his namesakes. The little recorded of them
in Ptolemaic times, even the legend of the seventy Pharaohs reigning
seventy days, betrays a troublous period and a rapid change of rulers.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The explanation of Prof. Lauth, according to which Manetho
     is supposed to have made an independent dynasty of the five
     Memphite priests who filled the interregnum of seventy days
     during the embalming of Nitokris, is certainly very
     ingenious, but that is all that can be said for it. The
     legendary source from which Manetho took his information
     distinctly recorded seventy successive kings, who reigned in
     all seventy days, a king a day.
</pre>
<p>
We know as a fact that the successors of Nitokris, in the Royal Turin
Papyrus, scarcely did more than appear upon the throne. Nofirkerî
reigned a year, a month, and a day; Nofîrûs, four years, two months,
and a day; Abu, two years, one month, and a day. Each of them hoped,
no doubt, to enjoy the royal power for a longer period than his
predecessors, and, like the Ati of the VIth dynasty, ordered a pyramid
to be designed for him without delay: not one of them had time to
complete the building, nor even to carry it sufficiently far to leave
any trace behind. As none of them had any tomb to hand his name down to
posterity, the remembrance of them perished with their contemporaries.
By dint of such frequent changes in the succession, the royal authority
became enfeebled, and its weakness favoured the growing influence of the
feudal families and encouraged their ambition. The descendants of those
great lords, who under Papi I. and II. made such magnificent tombs for
themselves, were only nominally subject to the supremacy of the reigning
sovereign; many of them were, indeed, grandchildren of princesses of the
blood, and possessed, or imagined that they possessed, as good a right
to the crown as the family on the throne. Memphis declined, became
impoverished, and dwindled in population. Its inhabitants ceased to
build those immense stone mastabas in which they had proudly displayed
their wealth, and erected them merely of brick, in which the decoration
was almost entirely confined to one narrow niche near the sarcophagus.
Soon the mastaba itself was given up, and the necropolis of the city was
reduced to the meagre proportions of a small provincial cemetery. The
centre of that government, which had weighed so long and so heavily upon
Egypt, was removed to the south, and fixed itself at Heracleopolis the
Great.
