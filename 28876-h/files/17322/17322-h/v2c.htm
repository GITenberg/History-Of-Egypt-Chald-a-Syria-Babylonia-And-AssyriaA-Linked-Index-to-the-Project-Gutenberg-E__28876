<h2>
    CHAPTER III&mdash;THE FIRST THEBAN EMPIRE
</h2>
<p>
<i>The two Heracleopolitan dynasties and the XIIth dynasty&mdash;The conquest
of Ethiopia, and the making of Greater Egypt by the Theban kings.</i>
</p>
<p>
The principality of the Oleander&mdash;Nârû&mdash;was bounded on the north by the
Memphite nome; the frontier ran from the left bank of the Nile to the
Libyan range, from the neighbourhood of Riqqah to that of Mêdûm. The
principality comprised the territory lying between the Nile and the Bahr
Yûsûf, from the above-mentioned two villages to the Harabshent Canal&mdash;a
district known to Greek geographers as the island of Heracleopolis;&mdash;it
moreover included the whole basin of the Fâyûm, on the west of the
valley. In very early times it had been divided into three parts: the
Upper Oleander&mdash;Nârû Khonîti&mdash;the Lower Oleander&mdash;Nârû Pahûi&mdash;and
the lake land&mdash;To-shît; and these divisions, united usually under
the supremacy of one chief, formed a kind of small state, of which
Heracleopolis was always the capital. The soil was fertile, well
watered, and well tilled, but the revenues from this district, confined
between the two arms of the river, were small in comparison with the
wealth which their ruler derived from his hands on the other side of the
mountain range. The Fayûm is approached by a narrow and winding gorge,
more than six miles in length&mdash;a depression of natural formation,
deepened by the hand of man to allow a free passage to the waters of the
Nile. The canal which conveys them leaves the Bahr Yûsûf at a point a
little to the north of Heracleopolis, carries them in a swift stream
through the gorge in the Libyan chain, and emerges into an immense
amphitheatre, whose highest side is parallel to the Nile valley, and
whose terraced slopes descend abruptly to about a hundred feet below the
level of the Mediterranean. Two great arms separate themselves from this
canal to the right and left&mdash;the Wady Tamieh and the Wady Nazleh; they
wind at first along the foot of the hills, and then again approaching
each other, empty themselves into a great crescent or horn-shaped lake,
lying east and west&mdash;the Moeris of Strabo, the Birket-Kerun of the
Arabs. A third branch penetrates the space enclosed by the other two,
passes the town of Shodû, and is then subdivided into numerous canals
and ditches, whose ramifications appear on the map as a network
resembling the reticulations of a skeleton leaf. The lake formerly
extended beyond its present limits, and submerged districts from which
it has since withdrawn.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Most of the specialists who have latterly investigated the
     Fayûm have greatly exaggerated the extent of the Birket-
     Kerûn in historic times. Prof. Petrie states that it covered
     the whole of the present province throughout the time of the
     Memphite kings, and that it was not until the reign of
     Amenemhâît I. that even a very small portion was drained.
     Major Brown adopts this theory, and considers that it was
     under Amenemhâît III. that the great lake of the Fayûm was
     transformed into a kind of artificial reservoir, which was
     the Mceris of Herodotus. The city of Shodû, Shadû, Shadît&mdash;
     the capital of the Fayûm&mdash;and its god Sovkû are mentioned
     even in the Pyramid texts: and the eastern district of the
     Fayûm is named in the inscription of Amten, under the IIIrd
     dynasty.

<p>
In years when the inundation was excessive, the surplus waters were
discharged into the lake; when, however, there was a low Nile, the
storage which had not been absorbed by the soil was poured back into
the valley by the same channels, and carried down by the Bahr-Yûsûf to
augment the inundation of the Western Delta.

     Museum.

<p>
The Nile was the source of everything in this principality, and hence
they were gods of the waters who received the homage of the three nomes.
The inhabitants of Heracleopolis worshipped the ram Harshafîtû, with
whom they associated Osiris of Narûdûf as god of the dead; the people
of the Upper Oleander adored a second ram, Khnûmû of Hâsmonîtû, and the
whole Fayûm was devoted to the cult of Sovkû the crocodile. Attracted by
the fertility of the soil, the Pharaohs of the older dynasties had
from time to time taken up their residence in Heracleopolis or its
neighbourhood, and one of them&mdash;Snofrûi&mdash;had built his pyramid at Mêdûm,
close to the frontier of the nome. In proportion as the power of the
Memphites declined, the princes of the Oleander grew more vigorous and
enterprising; and when the Memphite kings passed away, these princes
succeeded their former masters and sat "upon the throne of Horus."
</p>
<p>
The founder of the IXth dynasty was perhaps Khîti I., Miribrî, the
Akhthoës of the Greeks. He ruled over all Egypt, and his name has been
found on rocks at the first cataract. A story dating from the time of
the Ramessides mentions his wars against the Bedouin of the regions east
of the Delta; and what Manetho relates of his death is merely a romance,
in which the author, having painted him as a sacrilegious tyrant like
Kheops and Khephren, states that he was dragged down under the water and
there devoured by a crocodile or hippopotamus, the appointed avengers of
the offended gods. His successors seem to have reigned ingloriously
for more than a century. Their deeds are unknown to history, but it
was under the reign of one of them&mdash;Nibkaûrî&mdash;that a travelling fellah,
having been robbed of his earnings by an artisan, is said to have
journeyed to Heracleopolis to demand justice from the governor, or
to charm him by the eloquence of his pleadings and the variety of his
metaphors. It would, of course, be idle to look for the record of any
historic event in this story; the common people, moreover, do not long
remember the names of unimportant princes, and the tenacity with
which the Egyptians treasured the memories of several kings of the
Heracleopolitan line amply proves that, whether by their good or evil
qualities, they had at least made a lasting impression upon the popular
imagination.

</pre>
<p>
The history of this period, as far as we can discern it through the
mists of the past, appears to be one confused struggle: from north to
south war raged without intermission; the Pharaohs fought against their
rebel vassals, the nobles fought among themselves, and&mdash;what scarcely
amounted to warfare&mdash;there were the raids on all sides of pillaging
bands, who, although too feeble to constitute any serious danger to
large cities, were strong enough either in numbers or discipline to
render the country districts uninhabitable, and to destroy national
prosperity. The banks of the Nile already bristled with citadels,
where the monarchs lived and kept watch over the lands subject to their
authority: other fortresses were established wherever any commanding
site&mdash;such as a narrow part of the river, or the mouth of a defile
leading into the desert&mdash;presented itself. All were constructed on
the same plan, varied only by the sizes of the areas enclosed, and the
different thickness of the outer walls. The outline of their ground-plan
formed a parallelogram, whose enclosure wall was often divided into
vertical panels easily distinguished by the different arrangements of
the building material. At El-Kab and other places the courses of crude
brick are slightly concave, somewhat resembling a wide inverted arch
whose outer curve rests on the ground. In other places there was a
regular alternation of lengths of curved courses, with those in which
the courses were strictly horizontal. The object of this method of
structure is still unknown, but it is thought that such building offers
better resistance to shocks of earthquake. The most ancient fortress
at Abydos, whose ruins now lie beneath the mound of Kom-es-Sultân, was
built in this way. Tombs having encroached upon it by the time of the
VIth dynasty, it was shortly afterwards replaced by another and similar
fort, situate rather more than a hundred yards to the south-east;
the latter is still one of the best-preserved specimens of military
architecture dating from the times immediately preceding the first
Theban empire.*
</p>
<pre>
     * My first opinion was that the second fortress had been
     built towards the time of the XVIIIth dynasty at the
     earliest, perhaps even under the XXth. Further consideration
     of the details of its construction and decoration now leads
     me to attribute it to the period between the VIth and XIIth
     dynasties.

The exterior is unbroken by towers or projections of any kind, and
consists of four sides, the two longer of which are parallel to each
other and measure 143 yards from east to west: the two shorter sides,
which are also parallel, measure 85 yards from north to south. The outer
wall is solid, built in horizontal courses, with a slight batter, and
decorated by vertical grooves, which at all hours of the day diversify
the surface with an incessant play of light and shade. When perfect it
can hardly have been less than 40 feet in height. The walk round the
ramparts was crowned by a slight, low parapet, with rounded battlements,
and was reached by narrow staircases carefully constructed in the
thickness of the walls. A battlemented covering wall, about five and a
half yards high, encircled the building at a distance of some four feet.
The fortress itself was entered by two gates, and posterns placed at
various points between them provided for sorties of the garrison. The
principal entrance was concealed in a thick block of building at the
southern extremity of the east front. The corresponding entrance in
the covering wall was a narrow opening closed by massive wooden doors;
behind it was a small <i>place d'armes</i>, at the further end of which was
a second gate, as narrow as the first, and leading into an oblong court
hemmed in between the outer rampart and two bastions projecting at right
angles from it; and lastly, there was a gate purposely placed at the
furthest and least obvious corner of the court. Such a fortress was
strong enough to resist any modes of attack then at the disposal of the
best-equipped armies, which knew but three ways of taking a place by
force, viz. scaling, sapping, and breaking open the gates. The height
of the walls effectually prevented scaling. The pioneers were kept at
a distance by the brave, but if a breach were made in that, the small
flanking galleries fixed outside the battlements enabled the besieged to
overwhelm the enemy with stones and javelins as they approached, and to
make the work of sapping almost impossible. Should the first gate of
the fortress yield to the assault, the attacking party would be crowded
together in the courtyard as in a pit, few being able to enter together;
they would at once be constrained to attack the second gate under a
shower of missiles, and did they succeed in carrying that also, it was
at the cost of enormous sacrifice. The peoples of the Nile Valley
knew nothing of the swing battering-ram, and no representation of
the hand-worked battering-ram has ever been found in any of their
wall-paintings or sculptures; they forced their way into a stronghold
by breaking down its gates with their axes, or by setting fire to its
doors.

<p>
While the sappers were hard at work, the archers endeavoured, by the
accuracy of their aim, to clear the enemy from the curtain, while
soldiers sheltered behind movable mantelets tried to break down the
defences and dismantle the flanking galleries with huge metal-tipped
lances. In dealing with a resolute garrison none of these methods proved
successful; nothing but close siege, starvation, or treachery could
overcome its resistance.
</p>
<p>
The equipment of Egyptian troops was lacking in uniformity, and men
armed with slings, or bows and arrows, lances, wooden swords, clubs,
stone or metal axes, all fought side by side. The head was protected
by a padded cap, and the body by shields, which were small for light
infantry, but of great width for soldiers of the line. The issue of a
battle depended upon a succession of single combats between foes armed
with the same weapons; the lancers alone seem to have charged in line
behind their huge bucklers. As a rule, the wounds were trifling, and the
great skill with which the shields were used made the risk of injury to
any vital part very slight. Sometimes, however, a lance might be driven
home into a man's chest, or a vigorously wielded sword or club might
fracture a combatant's skull and stretch him unconscious on the ground.
With the exception of those thus wounded and incapacitated for flight,
very few prisoners were taken, and the name given to them, "Those struck
down alive"&mdash;<i>sokirûonkhû</i>&mdash;sufficiently indicates the method of their
capture. The troops were recruited partly from the domains of military
fiefs, partly from tribes of the desert or Nubia, and by their aid
the feudal princes maintained the virtual independence which they had
acquired for themselves under the last kings of the Memphite line.
Here and there, at Hermopolis, Shit, and Thebes, they founded actual
dynasties, closely connected with the Pharaonic dynasty, and even
occasionally on an equality with it, though they assumed neither
the crown nor the double cartouche. Thebes was admirably adapted for
becoming the capital of an important state. It rose on the right bank
of the Nile, at the northern end of the curve made by the river towards
Hermonthis, and in the midst of one of the most fertile plains of Egypt.
Exactly opposite to it, the Libyan range throws out a precipitous spur
broken up by ravines and arid amphitheatres, and separated from the
river-bank by a mere strip of cultivated ground which could be easily
defended. A troop of armed men stationed on this neck of land could
command the navigable arm of the Nile, intercept trade with Nubia at
their pleasure, and completely bar the valley to any army attempting to
pass without having first obtained authority to do so. The advantages
of this site do not seem to have been appreciated during the Memphite
period, when the political life of Upper Egypt was but feeble.
Elephantine, El-Kab, and Koptos were at that period the principal cities
of the country. Elephantine particularly, owing to its trade with the
Soudan, and its constant communication with the peoples bordering the
Red Sea, was daily increasing in importance. Hermonthis, the Aûnû of the
South, occupied much the same position, from a religious point of view,
as was held in the Delta by Heliopolis, the Aûnû of the North, and its
god Montû, a form of the Solar Horus, disputed the supremacy with Mînû,
of Koptos. Thebes long continued to be merely an insignificant village
of the Uisit nome and a dependency of Hermonthis. It was only towards
the end of the VIIIth dynasty that Thebes began to realize its power,
after the triumph of feudalism over the crown had culminated in the
downfall of the Memphite kings.

A family which, to judge from the fact that its members affected the
name of Monthotpû, originally came from Hermonthis, settled in Thebes
and made that town the capital of a small principality, which rapidly
enlarged its borders at the expense of the neighbouring nomes. All the
towns and cities of the plain, Mâdûfc, Hfûîfc, Zorît, Hermonthis,
and towards the south, Aphroditopolis Parva, at the gorge of the Two
Mountains (Gebelên) which formed the frontier of the fief of El-Kab,
Kûsît towards the north, Denderah, and Hû, all fell into the hands of
the Theban princes and enormously increased their territory. After the
lapse of a very few years, their supremacy was accepted more or less
willingly by the adjacent principalities of El-Kab, Elephantine, Koptos,
Qasr-es-Sayad, Thinis, and Ekhmîm. Antûf, the founder of the family,
claimed no other title than that of Lord of Thebes, and still submitted
to the suzerainty of the Heracleopolitan kings. His successors
considered themselves strong enough to cast off this allegiance, if
not to usurp all the insignia of royalty, including the uraeus and the
cartouche. Monthotpû I., Antûf II., and Antûf III. must have occupied a
somewhat remarkable position among the great lords of the south, since
their successors credited them with the possession of a unique preamble.
It is true that the historians of a later date did not venture to
place them on a par with the kings who were actually independent; they
enclosed their names in the cartouche without giving them a prenomen;
but, at the same time, they invested them with a title not met with
elsewhere, that of the first Horus&mdash;<i>Horû tapi</i>. They exercised
considerable power from the outset. It extended over Southern Egypt,
over Nubia, and over the valleys lying between the Nile and the Red
Sea.* The origin of the family was somewhat obscure, but in support
of their ambitious projects, they did not fail to invoke the memory of
pretended alliances between their ancestors and daughters of the solar
race; they boasted of their descent from the Papis, from Usirnirî Anû,
Sahûri, and Snofrûi, and claimed that the antiquity of their titles did
away with the more recent rights of their rivals.
</p>
<p>
The revolt of the Theban princes put an end to the IXth dynasty, and,
although supported by the feudal powers of Central and Northern Egypt,
and more especially by the lords of the Terebinth nome, who viewed the
sudden prosperity of the Thebans with a very evil eye, the Xth dynasty
did not succeed in bringing them back to their allegiance.**
</p>
<pre>
     * In the "Hall of Ancestors" the title of "Horus" is
     attributed to several Antûfs and Monthotpûs bearing the
     cartouche. This was probably the compiler's ingenious device
     for marking the subordinate position of these personages as
     compared with that of the Heracleopolitan Pharaohs, who
     alone among their contemporaries had a right to be placed on
     such official lists, even when those lists were compiled
     under the great Theban dynasties. The place in the XIth
     dynasty of princes bearing the title of "Horus" was first
     determined by E. de Rougé.

     ** The history of the house of Thebes was restored at the
     same time as that of the Heracleopolitan dynasties, by
     Maspero, in the <i>Revue Critique</i>, 1889, vol. ii. p. 220. The
     difficulty arising from the number of the Theban kings
     according to Manetho, considered in connection with the
     forty-three years which made the total duration of the
     dynasty, has been solved by Barucchi, <i>Discord critici
     sojpra la Cronologia Egizia</i>, pp. 131-134. These forty-three
     years represent the length of time that the Theban dynasty
     reigned alone, and which are ascribed to it in the Royal
     Canon; but the number of its kings includes, besides the
     recognized Pharaohs of the line, those princes who were
     contemporary with the Heracleopolitan rulers and are
     officially reckoned as forming the Xth dynasty.
</pre>
<p>
The family which held the fief of Siût when the war broke out, had
ruled there for three generations. Its first appearance on the scene of
history coincided with the accession of Akhthoës, and its elevation was
probably the reward of services rendered by its chief to the head of the
Heracleopolitan family.*
</p>
<pre>
     * By ascribing to the princes of Siut an average reign equal
     to that of the Pharaohs, and admitting with Lepsius that the
     IXth dynasty consisted of four or five kings, the accession
     of the first of these princes would practically coincide
     with the reign of Akhthoës. The name of Khîti, borne by two
     members of this little local dynasty, may have been given in
     memory of the Pharaoh Khiti Miribrî; there was also a second
     Khîti among the Heracleopolitan sovereigns, and one of the
     Khîtis of Siut may have been his contemporary. The family
     claimed a long descent, and said of itself that it was "an
     ancient litter"; but the higher rank and power of "prince"
     &mdash;hiqû&mdash;it owed to Khîti I. [Miribri?&mdash;Ed.] or some other
     king of the Heracleo-politian line.

<p>
From this time downwards, the title of "ruler"&mdash;<i>hiqû</i>&mdash;which the
Pharaohs themselves sometimes condescended to take, was hereditary in
the family, who grew in favour from year to year. Khiti I., the fourth
of this line of princes, was brought up in the palace of Heracleopolis,
and had learned to swim with the royal children. On his return home
he remained the personal friend of the king, and governed his domains
wisely, clearing the canals, fostering agriculture, and lightening the
taxes without neglecting the army. His heavy infantry, recruited from
among the flower of the people of the north, and his light infantry,
drawn from the pick of the people of the south, were counted by
thousands. He resisted the Theban pretensions with all his might, and
his son Tefabi followed in his footsteps. "The first time," said he,
"that my foot-soldiers fought against the nomes of the south which were
gathered together from Elephantine in the south to Gau on the north,
I conquered those nomes, I drove them towards the southern frontier, I
overran the left bank of the Nile in all directions. When I came to a
town I threw down its walls, I seized its chief, I imprisoned him at the
port (landing-place) until he paid me ransom. As soon as I had finished
with the left bank, and there were no longer found any who dared resist,
I passed to the right bank; like a swift hare I set full sail for
another chief.... I sailed by the north wind as by the east, by the
south as by the west, and him whose ship I boarded I vanquished utterly;
he was cast into the water, his boats fled to shore, his soldiers were
as bulls on whom falleth the lion; I compassed his city from end to end,
I seized his goods, I cast them into the fire." Thanks to his energy and
courage, he "extinguished the rebellion by the counsel and according to
the tactics of the jackal Uapûaîtû, god of Siût."

<p>
From that time "no district of the desert was safe from his terrors,"
and he "carried flame at his pleasure among the nomes of the south."
Even while bringing desolation to his foes, he sought to repair the ills
which the invasion had brought upon his own subjects. He administered
such strict justice that evil-doers disappeared as though by magic.
"When night came, he who slept on the roads blessed me, because he was
as safe as in his own house; for the fear which was shed abroad by my
soldiers protected him; and the cattle in the fields were as safe there
as in the stable; the thief had become an abomination to the god, and he
no longer oppressed the serf, so that the latter ceased to complain, and
paid the exact dues of his land for love of me." In the time of Khîti
II., the son of Tefabi, the Heracleopolitans were still masters of
Northern Egypt, but their authority was even then menaced by the
turbulence of their own vassals, and Heracleopolis itself drove out the
Pharaoh Mirikarî, who was obliged to take refuge in Siût with that Kkîti
whom he called his father. Khîti gathered together such an extensive
fleet that it encumbered the Nile from Shashhotpû to Gebel-Abufodah,
from one end of the principality of the Terebinth to the other. Vainly
did the rebels unite with the Thebans; Khîti "sowed terror over the
world, and himself alone chastised the nomes of the south." While he was
descending the river to restore the king to his capital, "the sky grew
serene, and the whole country rallied to him; the commanders of the
south and the archons of Heracleopolis, their legs tremble beneath them
when the royal urous, ruler of the world, comes to suppress crime; the
earth trembles, the South takes ship and flies, all men flee in dismay,
the towns surrender, for fear takes hold on their members." Mirikarî's
return was a triumphal progress: "when he came to Heracleopolis the
people ran forth to meet him, rejoicing in their lord; women and men
together, old men as well as children." But fortune soon changed. Beaten
again and again, the Thebans still returned to the attack; at length
they triumphed, after a struggle of nearly two hundred years, and
brought the two rival divisions of Egypt under their rule.

The few glimpses to be obtained of the early history of the first
Theban dynasty give the impression of an energetic and intelligent race.
Confined to the most thinly populated, that is, the least fertile part
of the valley, and engaged on the north in a ceaseless warfare which
exhausted their resources, they still found time for building both at
Thebes and in the most distant parts of their dominions. If their power
made but little progress southwards, at least it did not recede, and
that part of Nubia lying between Aswan and the neighbourhood of Korosko
remained in their possession. The tribes of the desert, the Amamiû, the
Mâzaiû, and the Uaûaiû often disturbed the husbandmen by their sudden
raids; yet, having pillaged a district, they did not take possession of
it as conquerors, but hastily returned to their mountains. The Theban
princes kept them in check by repeated counter-raids, and renewed the
old treaties with them. The inhabitants of the Great Oasis in the west,
and the migratory peoples of the Land of the Gods, recognized the Theban
suzerainty on the traditional terms.

As in the times of Uni, the barbarians made up the complement of the
army with soldiers who were more inured to hardships and more accustomed
to the use of arms than the ordinary fellahîn; and several obscure
Pharaohs&mdash;such as Monthotpû I. and Antûf III.&mdash;owed their boasted
victories over Libyans and Asiatics* to the energy of their mercenaries.

     * The cartouches of Antûfâa, inscribed on the rocks of
     Elephantine, are the record of a visit which this prince
     paid to Syenê, probably on his return from some raid; many
     similar inscriptions of Pharaohs of the XIIth dynasty were
     inscribed in analogous circumstances. Nûbkhopirrî Antûf
     boasted of having worsted the Amû and the negroes. On one of
     the rocks of the island of Konosso, Monthotpû Nibhotpûrî
     sculptured a scene of offerings in which the gods are
     represented as granting him victory over all peoples. Among
     the ruins of the temple which he built at Gebelên, is a
     scene in which he is presenting files of prisoners from
     different countries to the Theban gods.
</pre>
<p>
But the kings of the XIth dynasty were careful not to wander too far
from the valley of the Nile. Egypt presented a sufficiently wide field
for their activity, and they exerted themselves to the utmost to remedy
the evils from which the country had suffered for hundreds of years.
They repaired the forts, restored or enlarged the temples, and evidences
of their building are found at Koptos, Gebelên, El-Kab, and Abydos.
Thebes itself has been too often overthrown since that time for any
traces of the work of the XIth dynasty kings in the temple of Amon to
be distinguishable; but her necropolis is still full of their "eternal
homes," stretching in lines across the plain, opposite Karnak, at
Drah abû'l-Neggah, and on the northern slopes of the valley of
Deir-el-Baharî. Some were excavated in the mountain-side, and presented
a square façade of dressed stone, surmounted by a pointed roof in the
shape of a pyramid. Others were true pyramids, sometimes having a pair
of obelisks in front of them, as well as a temple. None of them
attained to the dimensions of the Memphite tombs; for, with only its own
resources at command, the kingdom of the south could not build monuments
to compete with those whose construction had taxed the united efforts of
all Egypt, but it used a crude black brick, made without grit or straw,
where the Egyptians of the north had preferred more costly stone. These
inexpensive pyramids were built on a rectangular base not more than six
and a half feet high; and the whole erection, which was simply faced
with whitewashed stucco, never exceeded thirty-three feet in height. The
sepulchral chamber was generally in the centre; in shape it resembled an
oven, its roof being "vaulted" by the overlapping of the courses.
Often also it was constructed partly in the base, and partly in the
foundations below the base, the empty space above it being intended
merely to lighten the weight of the masonry. There was not always an
external chapel attached to these tombs, but a stele placed on the
substructure, or fixed in one of the outer faces, marked the spot to
which offerings were to be brought for the dead; sometimes, however,
there was the addition of a square vestibule in front of the tomb,
and here, on prescribed days, the memorial ceremonies took place.
The statues of the double were rude and clumsy, the coffins heavy and
massive, and the figures with which they were decorated inelegant and
out of proportion, while the stelæ are very rudely cut. From the time
of the VIth dynasty the lords of the Saïd had been reduced to employing
workmen from Memphis to adorn their monuments; but the rivalry between
the Thebans and the Heracleopolitans, which set the two divisions of
Egypt against each other in constant hostility, obliged the Antufs to
entrust the execution of their orders to the local schools of sculptors
and painters. It is difficult to realize the degree of rudeness to
which the unskilled workmen who made certain of the Akhmîtn and Gebelên
sarcophagi must have sunk; and even at Thebes itself, or at Abydos, the
execution of both bas-reliefs and hieroglyphs shows minute carefulness
rather than any real skill or artistic feeling. Failing to attain to
the beautiful, the Egyptians endeavoured to produce the sumptuous.
Expeditions to the Wady Ham marnât to fetch blocks of granite for
sarcophagi become more and more frequent, and wells were sunk from point
to point along the road leading from Koptos to the mountains. Sometimes
these expeditions were made the occasion for pushing on as far as the
port of Saû and embarking on the Eed Sea. A hastily constructed boat
cruised along by the shore, and gum, incense, gold, and the precious
stones of the country were brought from the land of the Troglodytes. On
the return of the convoy with its block of stone, and various packages
of merchandise, there was no lack of scribes to recount the dangers of
the campaign in exaggerated language, or to congratulate the reigning
Pharaoh on having sown abroad the fame and terror of his name in the
countries of the gods, and as far as the land of Pûanît.
</p>
<p>
The final overthrow of the Heracleopolitan dynasty, and the union of the
two kingdoms under the rule of the Theban house, are supposed to have
been the work of that Monthotpû whose throne-name was Nibkhrôûrî;
his, at any rate, was the name which the Egyptians of Kamesside times
inscribed in the royal lists as that of the founder and most illustrious
representative of the XIth dynasty. The monuments commemorate his
victories over the Uaûaiû and the barbarous inhabitants of Nubia. Even
after he had conquered the Delta he still continued to reside in Thebes;
there he built his pyramid, and there divine honours were paid him from
the day after his decease. A scene carved on the rocks north of Silsileh
represents him as standing before his son Antûf; he is of gigantic
stature, and one of his wives stands behind him.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Brugsch makes him out to be a descendant of Amenemhâît,
     the prince of Thebes who lived under Monthotpu Nibtûirî, and
     who went to bring the stone for that Pharaoh's sarcophagus
     from the Wady Hammamât. He had previously supposed him to be
     this prince himself. Either of these hypotheses becomes
     probable, according as Nibtûirî is supposed to have lived
     before or after Nibkhrôûrî.

Three or four kings followed him in rapid succession; the least
insignificant among them appearing to have been a Monthotpii Nibtouiri.
Nothing but the prenomen&mdash;Sonkherî&mdash;is known of the last of these latter
princes, who was also the only one of them ever entered on the official
lists. In their hands the sovereignty remained unchanged from what it
had been almost uninterruptedly since the end of the VIth dynasty. They
solemnly proclaimed their supremacy, and their names were inscribed at
the head of public documents; but their power scarcely extended beyond
the limits of their family domain, and the feudal chiefs never concerned
themselves about the sovereign except when he evinced the power or will
to oppose them, allowing him the mere semblance of supremacy over the
greater part of Europe. Such a state of affairs could only be reformed
by revolution. Amenemhâît I., the leader of the new dynasty, was of the
Theban race; whether he had any claim to the throne, or by what means he
had secured the stability of his rule, we do not know. Whether he had
usurped the crown or whether he had inherited it legitimately, he showed
himself worthy of the rank to which fortune had raised him, and the
nobility saw in him a new incarnation of that type of kingship long
known to them by tradition only, namely, that of a Pharaoh convinced of
his own divinity and determined to assert it. He inspected the valley
from one end to another, principality by principality, nome by nome,
"crushing crime, and arising like Tûmû himself; restoring that which he
found in ruins, settling the bounds of the towns, and establishing for
each its frontiers." The civil wars had disorganized everything; no one
knew what ground belonged to the different nomes, what taxes were due
from them, nor how questions of irrigation could be equitably
decided. Amenemhâît set up again the boundary stelae, and restored its
dependencies to each nome: "He divided the waters among them according
to that which was in the cadastral surveys of former times." Hostile
nobles, or those whose allegiance was doubtful, lost the whole or part
of their fiefs; those who had welcomed the new order of things received
accessions of territory as the reward of their zeal and devotion.
Depositions and substitutions of princes had begun already in the time
of the XIth dynasty. Antûf V., for instance, finding the lord of Koptos
too lukewarm, had had him removed and promptly replaced. The fief of
Siût accrued to a branch of the family which was less warlike, and above
all less devoted to the old dynasty than that of Khîti had been. Part of
the nome of the Gazelle was added to the dominions of Nûhri, prince of
the Hare nome; the eastern part of the same nome, with Monaît-Khûfûi
as capital, was granted to his father-in-law, Khnûmhotpû I. Expeditions
against the Ûaûaiû, the Mâzaiû, and the nomads of Libya and Arabia
delivered the fellahîn from their ruinous raids and ensured to the
Egyptians safety from foreign attack. Amenemhâît had, moreover, the wit
to recognize that Thebes was not the most suitable place of residence
for the lord of all Egypt; it lay too far to the south, was thinly
populated, ill-built, without monuments, without prestige, and almost
without history. He gave it into the hands of one of his relations to
govern in his name, and proceeded to establish himself in the heart of
the country, in imitation of the glorious Pharaohs from whom he claimed
to be descended. But the ancient royal cities of Kheops and his children
had ceased to exist; Memphis, like Thebes, was now a provincial town,
and its associations were with the VIth and VIIIth dynasties only.
Amenemhâît took up his abode a little to the south of Dahshur, in the
palace of Titoûi, which he enlarged and made the seat of his government.
Conscious of being in the hands of a strong ruler, Egypt breathed freely
after centuries of distress, and her sovereign might in all sincerity
congratulate himself on having restored peace to his country. "I caused
the mourner to mourn no longer, and his lamentation was no longer
heard,&mdash;perpetual fighting was no longer witnessed,&mdash;while before my
coming they fought together as bulls unmindful of yesterday,&mdash;and no
man's welfare was assured, whether he was ignorant or learned."&mdash;"I
tilled the land as far as Elephantine,&mdash;I spread joy throughout the
country, unto the marshes of the Delta.&mdash;At my prayer the Nile granted
the inundation to the fields:&mdash;no man was an hungered under me, no
man was athirst under me,&mdash;for everywhere men acted according to my
commands, and all that I said was a fresh cause of love."
</p>
<p>
In the court of Amenemhâît, as about all Oriental sovereigns, there were
doubtless men whose vanity or interests suffered by this revival of
the royal authority; men who had found it to their profit to intervene
between Pharaoh and his subjects, and who were thwarted in their
intrigues or exactions by the presence of a prince determined on keeping
the government in his own hands.
</p>
<p>
These men devised plots against the new king, and he escaped with
difficulty from their conspiracies. "It was after the evening meal, as
night came on,&mdash;I gave myself up to pleasure for a time,&mdash;then I
lay down upon the soft coverlets in my palace, I abandoned myself to
repose,&mdash;and my heart began to be overtaken by slumber; when, lo! they
gathered together in arms to revolt against me,&mdash;and I became weak as
a serpent of the field.&mdash;Then I aroused myself to fight with my own
hands,&mdash;and I found that I had but to strike the unresisting.&mdash;When
I took a foe, weapon in hand, I make the wretch to turn and
flee;&mdash;strength forsook him, even in the night; there were none
who contended, and nothing vexatious was effected against me." The
conspirators were disconcerted by the promptness with which Amenemhâît
had attacked them, and apparently the rebellion was suppressed on the
same night in which it broke out. But the king was growing old, his son
Usirtasen was very young, and the nobles were bestirring themselves in
prospect of a succession which they supposed to be at hand. The best
means of putting a stop to their evil devices and of ensuring the future
of the dynasty was for the king to appoint the heir-presumptive, and at
once associate him with himself in the exercise of his sovereignty. In
the XXth year of his reign, Amenemhâît solemnly conferred the titles and
prerogatives of royalty upon his son Usirtasen: "I raised thee from the
rank of a subject,&mdash;I granted thee the free use of thy arm that thou
mightest be feared.&mdash;As for me, I apparelled myself in the fine
stuffs of my palace until I appeared to the eye as the flowers of my
garden,&mdash;and I perfumed myself with essences as freely as I pour forth
the water from my cisterns." Usirtasen naturally assumed the active
duties of royalty as his share. "He is a hero who wrought with the
sword, a mighty man of valour without peer: he beholds the barbarians,
he rushes forward and falls upon their predatory hordes. He is the
hurler of javelins who makes feeble the hands of the foe; those whom
he strikes never more lift the lance. Terrible is he, shattering skulls
with the blows of his war-mace, and none resisted him in his time. He is
a swift runner who smites the fugitive with the sword, but none who run
after him can overtake him. He is a heart alert for battle in his time.
He is a lion who strikes with his claws, nor ever lets go his weapon.
He is a heart girded in armour at the sight of the hosts, and who leaves
nothing standing behind him. He is a valiant man rushing forward when
he beholds the fight. He is a soldier rejoicing to fall upon the
barbarians: he seizes his buckler, he leaps forward and kills without
a second blow. None may escape his arrow; before he bends his bow the
barbarians flee from his arms like dogs, for the great goddess has
charged him to fight against all who know not her name, and whom
he strikes he spares not; he leaves nothing alive." The old Pharaoh
"remained in the palace," waiting until his son returned to announce
the success of his enterprises, and contributing by his counsel to the
prosperity of their common empire. Such was the reputation for wisdom
which he thus acquired, that a writer who was almost his contemporary
composed a treatise in his name, and in it the king was supposed to
address posthumous instructions to his son on the art of governing. He
appeared to his son in a dream, and thus admonished him: "Hearken unto
my words!&mdash;Thou art king over the two worlds, prince over the three
regions. Act still better than did thy predecessors.&mdash;Let there be
harmony between thy subjects and thee,&mdash;lest they give themselves up to
fear; keep not thyself apart in the midst of them; make not thy brother
solely from the rich and noble, fill not thy heart with them alone;
yet neither do thou admit to thy intimacy chance-comers whose place is
unknown." The king confirmed his counsels by examples taken from his
own life, and from these we have learned some facts in his history. The
little work was widely disseminated and soon became a classic; in the
time of the XIXth dynasty it was still copied in schools and studied
by young scribes as an exercise in style. Usirfcasen's share in the
sovereignty had so accustomed the Egyptians to consider this prince
as the king <i>de facto</i>, that they had gradually come to write his name
alone upon the monuments. When Amenemhâît died, after a reign of thirty
years, Ûsirtasen was engaged in a war against the Libyans. Dreading an
outbreak of popular feeling, or perhaps an attempted usurpation by
one of the princes of the blood, the high officers of the crown kept
Amenemhâît's death secret, and despatched a messenger to the camp to
recall the young king. He left his tent by night, unknown to the troops,
returned to the capital before anything had transpired among the
people, and thus the transition from the founder to his immediate
successor&mdash;always a delicate crisis for a new dynasty&mdash;seemed to
come about quite naturally. The precedent of co-regnancy having been
established, it was scrupulously followed by most of the succeeding
sovereigns. In the XIIIth year of his sovereignty, and after having
reigned alone for thirty-two years, Ûsirtasen I. shared his throne with
Amenemhâît II.; and thirty-two years later Amenemhâît II. acted in a
similar way with regard to Ûsirtasen II. Amenemhâît III. and Amenemhâît
IV. were long co-regnant. The only princes of this house in whose cases
any evidence of co-regnancy is lacking are Ûsirtasen III., and the queen
Sovknofriûrî, with whom the dynasty died out.

     Several Egyptologists have thought that Manetho had, in his

     consecutive, and have hence proposed to conclude that the
     dynasty only lasted 168 years (Brugscii), or 160 (Lieblein),

We are doubtless far from having any adequate idea of its great
achievements, for the biographies of its eight sovereigns, and the
details of their interminable wars are very imperfectly known to us. The
development of its foreign and domestic policy we can, however, follow

Asia had as little attraction for these kings as for their Memphite
predecessors; they seem to have always had a certain dread of its
warlike races, and to have merely contented themselves with repelling
their attacks. Amenemhâît I. had completed the line of fortresses across
the isthmus, and these were carefully maintained by his successors. The
Pharaohs were not ambitious of holding direct sway over the tribes of
the desert, and scrupulously avoided interfering with their affairs
as long as the "Lords of the Sands" agreed to respect the Egyptian
frontier. Commercial relations were none the less frequent and certain
on this account.

Dwellers by the streams of the Delta were accustomed to see the
continuous arrival in their towns of isolated individuals or of whole
bands driven from their homes by want or revolution, and begging for
refuge under the shadow of Pharaoh's throne, and of caravans offering
the rarest products of the north and of the east for sale. A celebrated
scene in one of the tombs of Beni-Hasan illustrates what usually took
place. We do not know what drove the thirty-seven Asiatics, men, women,
and children, to cross the Red Sea and the Arabian desert and hills in
the VIth year of Usirtasen II.;* they had, however, suddenly appeared in
the Gazelle nome, and were there received by Khîti, the superintendent
of the huntsmen, who, as his duty was, brought them before the prince
Khnûmhotpû.

     * This bas-relief was first noticed and described by
     Champollion, who took the immigrants for Greeks of the
     archaic period. Others have wished to consider it as
     representing Abraham, the sons of Jacob, or at least a band
     of Jews entering into Egypt, and on the strength of this
     hypothesis it has often been reproduced.
</pre>
<p>
The foreigners presented the prince with green eye-paint, antimony
powder, and two live ibexes, to conciliate his favour; while he, to
preserve the memory of their visit, had them represented in painting
upon the walls of his tomb. The Asiatics carry bows and arrows,
javelins, axes, and clubs, like the Egyptians, and wear long garments or
close-fitting loin-cloths girded on the thigh. One of them plays, as he
goes, on an instrument whose appearance recalls that of the old Greek
lyre. The shape of their arms, the magnificence and good taste of the
fringed and patterned stuffs with which they are clothed, the elegance
of most of the objects which they have brought with them, testify to a
high standard of civilisation, equal at least to that of Egypt. Asia had
for some time provided the Pharaohs with slaves, certain perfumes, cedar
wood and cedar essences, enamelled vases, precious stones, lapis-lazuli,
and the dyed and embroidered woollen fabrics of which Chaldæa kept the
monopoly until the time of the Komans. Merchants of the Delta braved
the perils of wild beasts and of robbers lurking in every valley, while
transporting beyond the isthmus products of Egyptian manufacture, such
as fine linens, chased or <i>cloisonné</i> jewellery, glazed pottery, and
glass paste or metal amulets. Adventurous spirits who found life dull
on the banks of the Nile, men who had committed crimes, or who believed
themselves suspected by their lords on political grounds, conspirators,
deserters, and exiles were well received by the Asiatic tribes, and
sometimes gained the favour of the sheikhs. In the time of the XIIth
dynasty, Southern Syria, the country of the "Lords of the Sands," and
the kingdom of Kadûma were full of Egyptians whose eventful careers
supplied the scribes and storytellers with the themes of many romances.
</p>
<p>
Sinûhît, the hero of one of these stories, was a son of Amenemhâît I.,
and had the misfortune involuntarily to overhear a state secret. He
happened to be near the royal tent when news of his father's sudden
death was brought to Usirtasen. Fearing summary execution, he fled
across the Delta north of Memphis, avoided the frontier-posts, and
struck into the desert. "I pursued my way by night; at dawn I had
reached Pûteni, and set out for the lake of Kîmoîrî. Then thirst fell
upon me, and the death-rattle was in my throat, my throat cleaved
together, and I said, 'It is the taste of death!' when suddenly I lifted
up my heart and gathered my strength together: I heard the lowing of the
herds. I perceived some Asiatics; their chief, who had been in Egypt,
knew me; he gave me water, and caused milk to be boiled for me, and
I went with him and joined his tribe." But still Sinûhît did not feel
himself in safety, and fled into Kadûma, to a prince who had provided an
asylum for other Egyptian exiles, and where he "could hear men speak the
language of Egypt." Here he soon gained honours and fortune. "The chief
preferred me before his children, giving me his eldest daughter in
marriage, and he granted me that I should choose for myself the best of
his land near the frontier of a neighbouring country. It is an excellent
land, Aîa is its name. Figs are there and grapes; wine is more plentiful
than water; honey abounds in it; numerous are its olives and all the
produce of its trees; there are corn and flour without end, and cattle
of all kinds. Great, indeed, was that which was bestowed upon me when
the prince came to invest me, installing me as prince of a tribe in the
best of his land. I had daily rations of bread and wine, day by day;
cooked meat and roasted fowl, besides the mountain game which I took, or
which was placed before me in addition to that which was brought me by
my hunting dogs. Much butter was made for me, and milk prepared in every
kind of way. There I passed many years, and the children which were born
to me became strong men, each ruling his own tribe. When a messenger was
going to the interior or returning from it, he turned aside from his way
to come to me, for I did kindness to all: I gave water to the thirsty,
I set again upon his way the traveller who had been stopped on it, I
chastised the brigand. The Pitaîtiû, who went on distant campaigns to
fight and repel the princes of foreign lands, I commanded them and
they marched forth; for the prince of Tonû made me the general of his
soldiers for long years. When I went forth to war, all countries towards
which I set out trembled in their pastures by their wells. I seized
their cattle, I took away their vassals and carried off their slaves, I
slew the inhabitants, the land was at the mercy of my sword, of my bow,
of my marches, of my well-conceived plans glorious to the heart of my
prince. Thus, when he knew my valour, he loved me, making me chief among
his children when he saw the strength of my arms.
</p>
<p>
"A valiant man of Tonu came to defy me in my tent; he was a hero beside
whom there was none other, for he had overthrown all his adversaries. He
said: 'Let Sinûhît fight with me, for he has not yet conquered me!' and
he thought to seize my cattle and therewith to enrich his tribe. The
prince talked of the matter with me. I said: 'I know him not. Verily,
I am not his brother. I keep myself far from his dwelling; have I ever
opened his door, or crossed his enclosures? Doubtless he is some jealous
fellow envious at seeing me, and who believes himself fated to rob me
of my cats, my goats, my kine, and to fall on my bulls, my rams, and my
oxen, to take them.... If he has indeed the courage to fight, let him
declare the intention of his heart! Shall the god forget him whom he has
heretofore favoured? This man who has challenged me to fight is as one
of those who lie upon the funeral couch. I bent my bow, I took out my
arrows, I loosened my poignard, I furbished my arms. At dawn all the
land of Tonu ran forth; its tribes were gathered together, and all the
foreign lands which were its dependencies, for they were impatient to
see this duel. Each heart was on live coals because of me; men and women
cried 'Ah!' for every heart was disquieted for my sake, and they said:
'Is there, indeed, any valiant man who will stand up against him? Lo!
the enemy has buckler, battle-axe, and an armful of javelins.' When he
had come forth and I appeared, I turned aside his shafts from me. When
not one of them touched me, he fell upon me, and then I drew my bow
against him. When my arrow pierced his neck, he cried out and fell to
the earth upon his nose; I snatched his lance from him, I shouted my cry
of victory upon his back. While the country people rejoiced, I made
his vassals whom he had oppressed to give thanks to Montu. This prince,
Ammiânshi, bestowed upon me all the possessions of the vanquished, and
I took away his goods, I carried off his cattle. All that he had desired
to do unto me that did I unto him; I took possession of all that was in
his tent, I despoiled his dwelling; therewith was the abundance of my
treasure and the number of my cattle increased." In later times, in
Arab romances such as that of Antar or that of Abû-Zeît, we find the
incidents and customs described in this Egyptian tale; there we have
the exile arriving at the court of a great sheikh whose daughter he
ultimately marries, the challenge, the fight, and the raids of one
people against another. Even in our own day things go on in much the
same way. Seen from afar, these adventures have an air of poetry and of
grandeur which fascinates the reader, and in imagination transports him
into a world more heroic and more noble than our own. He who cares to
preserve this impression would do well not to look too closely at the
men and manners of the desert. Certainly the hero is brave, but he
is still more brutal and treacherous; fighting is one object of his
existence, but pillage is a far more important one. How, indeed, should
it be otherwise? the soil is poor, life hard and precarious, and from
remotest antiquity the conditions of that life have remained unchanged;
apart from firearms and Islam, the Bedouin of to-day are the same as the
Bedouin of the days of Sinûhît.
</p>
<p>
There are no known documents from which we can derive any certain
information as to what became of the mining colonies in Sinai after the
reign of Papi II. Unless entirely abandoned, they must have lingered
on in comparative idleness; for the last of the Memphites, the
Heracleopohtans, and the early Thebans were compelled to neglect them,
nor was their active life resumed until the accession of the XIIth
dynasty. The veins in the Wady Maghara were much exhausted, but a series
of fortunate explorations revealed the existence of untouched deposits
in the Sarbût-el-Khâdîm, north of the original workings. From the time
of Amenemhâît II. these new veins were worked, and absorbed attention
during several generations. Expeditions to the mines were sent out every
three or four years, sometimes annually, under the command of such
high functionaries as "Acquaintances of the King," "Chief Lectors,"
and Captains of the Archers. As each mine was rapidly worked out, the
delegates of the Pharaohs were obliged to find new veins in order
to meet industrial demands. The task was often arduous, and the
commissioners generally took care to inform posterity very fully as to
the anxieties which they had felt, the pains which they had taken, and
the quantities of turquoise or of oxide of copper which they had brought
into Egypt. Thus the Captain Haroëris tells us that, on arriving at
Sarbût in the month Pha-menoth of an unknown year of Amenemhâît III.,
he made a bad beginning in his work of exploration. Wearied of fruitless
efforts, the workmen were quite ready to desert him if he had not put a
good face on the business and stoutly promised them the support of the
local Hâthor.

<p>
And, as a matter of fact, fortune did change. When he began to despair,
"the desert burned like summer, the mountain was on fire, and the vein
exhausted; one morning the overseer who was there questioned the miners,
the skilled workers who were used to the mine, and they said: 'There is
turquoise for eternity in the mountain.' At that very moment the vein
appeared." And, indeed, the wealth of the deposit which he found so
completely indemnified Haroëris for his first disappointments, that in
the month Pachons, three months after the opening of these workings, he
had finished his task and prepared to leave the country, carrying his
spoils with him. From time to time Pharaoh sent convoys of cattle and
provisions&mdash;corn, sixteen oxen, thirty geese, fresh vegetables, live
poultry&mdash;to his vassals at the mines.

The mining population increased so fast that two chapels were built,
dedicated to Hâthor, and served by volunteer priests. One of these
chapels, presumably the oldest, consists of a single rock-cut chamber,
upheld by one large square pillar, walls and pillar having been covered
with finely sculptured scenes and inscriptions which are now almost
effaced. The second chapel included a beautifully proportioned
rectangular court, once entered by a portico supported on pillars with
Hâthor-head capitals, and beyond the court a narrow building divided
into many small irregular chambers. The edifice was altered and rebuilt,
and half destroyed; it is now nothing by a confused heap of ruins, of
which the original plan cannot be traced. Votive stehe of all shapes and
sizes, in granite, sandstone, or limestone, were erected here and there
at random in the two chambers and in the courts between the columns, and
flush with the walls. Some are still <i>in situ</i>, others lie scattered in
the midst of the ruins. Towards the middle of the reign of Amenemhâît
III., the industrial demand for turquoise and for copper ore became so
great that the mines of Sarbût-el-Khâdîm could no longer meet it, and
those in the Wady Maghara were re-opened. The workings of both sets of
mines were carried on with unabated vigour under Amenemhâîfc IV., and
were still in full activity when the XIIIth dynasty succeeded the XIIth
on the Egyptian throne. Tranquillity prevailed in the recesses of the
mountains of Sinai as well as in the valley of the Nile, and a small
garrison sufficed to keep watch over the Bedouin of the neighbourhood.
Sometimes the latter ventured to attack the miners, and then fled in
haste, carrying off their meagre booty; but they were vigorously pursued
under the command of one of the officers on the spot, and generally
caught and compelled to disgorge their plunder before they had reached
the shelter of their "douars." The old Memphite kings prided themselves
on these armed pursuits as though they were real victories, and had them
recorded in triumphal bas-reliefs; but under the XIIth dynasty they were
treated as unimportant frontier incidents, almost beneath the notice
of the Pharaoh, and the glory of them&mdash;such as it was&mdash;he left to his
captains then in command of those districts.
</p>
<p>
Egypt had always kept up extensive commercial relations with certain
northern countries lying beyond the Mediterranean. The reputation for
wealth enjoyed by the Delta sometimes attracted bands of the Haiû-nîbû
to come prowling in piratical excursions along its shores; but their
expeditions seldom turned out successfully, and even if the adventurers
escaped summary execution, they generally ended their days as slaves in
the Fayûm, or in some village of the Said. At first their descendants
preserved the customs, religion, manners, and industries of their
distant home, and went on making rough pottery for daily use, which was
decorated in a style recalling that of vases found in the most ancient
tombs of the Ægean archipelago; but they were gradually assimilated
to their surroundings, and their grandchildren became fellahîn like the
rest, brought up from infancy in the customs and language of Egypt.
</p>
<p>
The relations with the tribes of the Libyan desert, the Tihûnû and the
Timihû, were almost invariably peaceful; although occasional raids of
one of their bands into Egyptian territory would provoke counter raids
into the valleys in which they took refuge with their flocks and herds.
Thus, in addition to the captive Haiû-nîbû, another heterogeneous
element, soon to be lost in the mass of the Egyptian population, was
supplied by detachments of Berber women and children.

The relations Egypt with her northern neighbours during the hundred
years of the XIIth dynasty were chiefly commercial, but occasionally
this peaceful intercourse was broken by sudden incursions or piratical
expeditions which called for active measures of repression, and were
the occasion of certain romantic episodes. The foreign policy of the
Pharaohs in this connexion was to remain strictly on the defensive.
Ethiopia attracted all their attention, and demanded all their strength.
The same instinct which had impelled their predecessors to pass
successively beyond Gebel-Silsileh and Elephantine now drove the XIIth
dynasty beyond the second cataract, and even further. The nature of the
valley compelled them to this course. From the Tacazze, or rather from
the confluence of the two Niles down to the sea, the whole valley forms
as it were a Greater Egypt; for although separated by the cataracts
into different divisions, it is everywhere subject to the same physical
conditions. In the course of centuries it has more than once been
forcibly dismembered by the chances of war, but its various parts have
always tended to reunite, and have coalesced at the first opportunity.
The Amami, the Irittt, and the Sitiu, all those nations which wandered
west of the river, and whom the Pharaohs of the VIth and subsequently of
the XIth dynasty either enlisted into their service or else conquered,
do not seem to have given much trouble to the successors of Amenemhâît
I. The Ûaûaiû and the Mâzaiû were more turbulent, and it was necessary
to subdue them in order to assure the tranquillity of the colonists
scattered along the banks of the river from Philo to Korosko. They were
worsted by Amenemhâît I. in several encounters.
</p>
<p>
Ûsirtasen I. made repeated campaigns against them, the earlier ones
being undertaken in his father's lifetime. Afterwards he pressed on, and
straightway "raised his frontiers" at the rapids of Wady Haifa; and the
country was henceforth the undisputed property of his successors. It was
divided into nomes like Egypt itself; the Egyptian language succeeded in
driving out the native dialects, and the local deities, including Didûn,
the principal god, were associated or assimilated with the gods of
Egypt. Khnûmû was the favourite deity of the northern nomes, doubtless
because the first colonists were natives of Elephantine, and subjects
of its princes. In the southern nomes, which had been annexed under the
Theban kings and were peopled with Theban immigrants, the worship of
Khnûmû was carried on side by side with the worship of Amon, or Amon-Ra,
god of Thebes. In accordance with local affinities, now no longer
intelligible, the other gods also were assigned smaller areas in the new
territory&mdash;Thot at Pselcis and Pnûbsît, where a gigantic nabk tree was
worshipped, Râ near Derr, and Horus at Miama and Baûka. The Pharaohs
who had civilized the country here received divine honours while still
alive. Ûsirtasen III. was placed in triads along with Didûn, Amon, and
Khnûmû; temples were raised to him at Semneh, Shotaûi, and Doshkeh;
and the anniversary of a decisive victory which he had gained over the
barbarians was still celebrated on the 21st of Pachons, a thousand years
afterwards, under Thutmosis III. The feudal system spread over the land
lying between the two cataracts, where hereditary barons held their
courts, trained their armies, built their castles, and excavated their
superbly decorated tombs in the mountain-sides. The only difference
between Nubian Egypt and Egypt proper lay in the greater heat and
smaller wealth of the former, where the narrower, less fertile, and
less well-watered land supported a smaller population and yielded less
abundant revenues.
</p>
<p>
The Pharaoh kept the charge of the more important strategical points
in his own hands. Strongholds placed at bends of the river and at
the mouths of ravines leading into the desert, secured freedom of
navigation, and kept off the pillaging nomads. The fortress of Derr
[Kubbân?&mdash;Ed.], which was often rebuilt, dates in part at least from
the early days of the conquest of Nubia. Its rectangular boundary&mdash;a
dry brick wall&mdash;is only broken by easily filled up gaps, and with some
repairs it would still resist an Ababdeh attack.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The most ancient bricks in the fortifications of Derr,
     easily distinguishable from those belonging to the later
     restorations, are identical in shape and size with those of
     the walls at Syene and El-Kab; and the wall at El-Kab was
     certainly built not later than the XIIth dynasty.
</pre>
<p>
The most considerable Nubian works of the XIIth dynasty were in the
three places from which the country can even now be most effectively
commanded, namely, at the two cataracts, and in the districts extending
from Derr to Dakkeh. Elephantine already possessed an entrenched camp
which commanded the rapids and the land route from Syene to Philo.
Usirtasen III. restored its great wall; he also cleared and widened
the passage to Sériel, as did Papi I. to such good effect that easy and
rapid communication between Thebes and the new towns was at all times
practicable. Some little distance from Phihe he established a station
for boats, and an emporium which he called Hirû Khâkerî&mdash;"the Ways of
Khâkerî"&mdash;after his own throne name&mdash;Khâkerî.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The widening of the passage was effected in the VIIIth
     year of his reign, the same year in which he established the
     Egyptian frontier at Semneh. The other constructions are
     mentioned, but not very clearly, in a stele of the same year
     which came from Elephantine, and is now in the British
     Museum. The votive tablet, engraved in honour of Anûkît at
     Sehêl, in which the king boasts of having made for the
     goddess "the excellent channel [called] 'the Ways of
     Khâkeûrî,'" probably refers to this widening and deepening
     of the passage in the VIIIth year.
</pre>
<p>
Its exact site is unknown, but it appears to have completed on the
south side the system of walls and redoubts which protected the cataract
provinces against either surprise or regular attacks of the barbarians.
Although of no appreciable use for the purposes of general security, the
fortifications of Middle Nubia were of great importance in the eyes of
the Pharaohs. They commanded the desert roads leading to the Eed Sea,
and to Berber and Gebel Barkel on the Upper Nile. The most important
fort occupied the site of the present village of Kuban, opposite Dakkeh,
and commanded the entrance to the Wady Olaki, which leads to the richest
gold deposits known to Ancient Egypt. The valleys which furrow the
mountains of Etbai, the Wady Shauanîb, the Waddy Umm Teyur, Gebel Iswud,
Gebel Umm Kabriteh, all have gold deposits of their own. The gold is
found in nuggets and in pockets in white quartz, mixed with iron oxides
and titanium, for which the ancients had no use. The method of mining
practised from immemorial antiquity by the Uaûaiû of the neighbourhood
was of the simplest, and traces of the workings may be seen all over the
sides of the ravines. Tunnels followed the direction of the lodes to a
depth of fifty-five to sixty-five yards; the masses of quartz procured
from them were broken up in granite mortars, pounded small and
afterwards reduced to a powder in querns, similar to those used for
crushing grain; the residue was sifted on stone tables, and the finely
ground parts afterwards washed in bowls of sycamore wood, until the gold
dust had settled to the bottom.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The gold-mines and the method of working them under the
     Ptolemies have been described by Agatharchides; the
     processes employed were very ancient, and had hardly changed
     since the time of the first Pharaohs, as is shown by a
     comparison of the mining tools found in these districts with
     those which have been collected at Sinai, in the turquoise-
     mines of the Ancient Empire.
</pre>
<p>
This was the Nubian gold which was brought into Egypt by nomad tribes,
and for which the Egyptians themselves, from the time of the XIIth
dynasty onwards, went to seek in the land which produced it. They made
no attempt to establish permanent colonies for working the mines, as at
Sinai; but a detachment of troops was despatched nearly every year to
the spot to receive the amount of precious metal collected since their
previous visit. The king Usirtasen would send at one time the prince of
the nome of the Gazelle on such an expedition, with a contingent of
four hundred men belonging to his fief; at another time, it would be
the faithful Sihâthor who would triumphantly scour the country, obliging
young and old to work with redoubled efforts for his master Amenemhâît
II. On his return the envoy would boast of having brought back more gold
than any of his predecessors, and of having crossed the desert without
losing either a soldier or a baggage animal, not even a donkey.

Sometimes a son of the reigning Pharaoh, even the heir-presumptive,
would condescend to accompany the caravan. Amenemhâît III. repaired or
rebuilt the fortress of Kubbân, the starting-place of the little army,
and the spot to which it returned. It is a square enclosure measuring
328 feet on each side; the ramparts of crude brick are sloped slightly
inwards, and are strengthened at intervals by bastions projecting from
the external face of the wall. The river protected one side; the other
three were defended by ditches communicating with the Nile. There were
four entrances, one in the centre of each façade: that on the east,
which faced the desert, and was exposed to the severest attacks, was
flanked by a tower.
</p>
<p>
The cataract of Wady Haifa offered a natural barrier to invasion from
the south. Even without fortification, the chain of granite rocks which
crosses the valley at this spot would have been a sufficient obstacle to
prevent any fleet which might attempt the passage from gaining access to
northern Nubia.

The Nile here has not the wild and imposing aspect which it assumes
lower down, between Aswan and Philae. It is bordered by low and receding
hills, devoid of any definite outline. Masses of bare black rock, here
and there covered by scanty herbage, block the course of the river in
some places in such profusion, that its entire bed seems to be taken
up by them. For a distance of seventeen miles the main body of water
is broken up into an infinitude of small channels in its width of
two miles; several of the streams thus formed present, apparently, a
tempting course to the navigator, so calm and safe do they appear, but
they conceal ledges of hidden reefs, and are unexpectedly forced into
narrow passages obstructed by granite boulders. The strongest built and
best piloted boat must be dashed to pieces in such circumstances, and
no effort or skilfulness on the part of the crew would save the vessel
should the owner venture to attempt the descent. The only channel at
all available for transit runs from the village of Aesha on the Arabian
side, winds capriciously from one bank to another, and emerges into calm
water a little above Nakhiet Wady Haifa. During certain days in August
and September the natives trust themselves to this stream, but only with
boats lightly laden; even then their escape is problematical, for they
are in hourly danger of foundering. As soon as the inundation begins to
fall, the passage becomes more difficult: by the middle of October it
is given up, and communication by water between Egypt and the countries
above Wady Haifa is suspended until the return of the inundation. By
degrees, as the level of the water becomes lower, remains of wrecks
jammed between the rocks, or embedded in sandbanks, emerge into view,
as if to warn sailors and discourage them from an undertaking so fraught
with perils. Usirtasen I. realized the importance of the position, and
fortified its approaches.

He selected the little Nubian town of Bohani, which lay exactly opposite
to the present village of Wady Haifa, and transformed it into a strong
frontier fortress. Besides the usual citadel, he built there a temple
dedicated to the Theban god Amon and to the local Horus; he then set
up a stele commemorating his victories over the peoples beyond the
cataract.

Ten of their principal chiefs had passed before Amon as prisoners, their
arms tied behind their backs, and had been sacrificed at the foot of
the altar by the sovereign himself: he represented them on the stele by
enclosing their names in battlemented cartouches, each surmounted by
the bust of a man bound by a long cord which is held by the conqueror.
</p>
<p>
Nearly a century later Ûsirtasen III. enlarged the fortress, and finding
doubtless that it was not sufficiently strong to protect the passage of
the cataract, he stationed outposts at various points, at Matûga, Fakus,
and Kassa. They served as mooring-places where the vessels which went
up and down stream with merchandise might be made fast to the bank at
sunset. The bands of Bedouin, lurking in the neighbourhood, would
have rejoiced to surprise them, and by their depredations to stop the
commerce between the Said and the Upper Nile, during the few weeks in
which it could be carried on with a minimum of danger. A narrow gorge
crossed by a bed of granite, through which the Nile passes at Semneh,
afforded another most favourable site for the completion of this
system of defence. On cliffs rising sheer above the current, the
king constructed two fortresses, one on each bank of the river, which
completely commanded the approaches by land and water. On the right bank
at Kummeh, where the position was naturally a strong one, the engineers
described an irregular square, measuring about two hundred feet each
side; two projecting bastions flanked the entrance, the one to the
north covering the approaching pathways, the southern one commanding
the river-bank. A road with a ditch runs at about thirteen feet from the
walls round the building, closely following its contour, except at the
north-west and south-east angles, where there are two projections which
formed bastions. The town on the other bank, Samninû-Kharp-Khâkerî,
occupied a less favourable position: its eastern flank was protected by
a zone of rocks and by the river, but the three other sides were of easy
approach. They were provided with ramparts which rose to the height
of eighty-two feet above the plain, and were strengthened at unequal
distances by enormous buttresses. These resembled towers without
parapets, overlooking every part of the encircling road, and from them
the defenders could take the attacking sappers in flank.

<p>
The intervals between them had been so calculated as to enable the
archers to sweep the intervening space with their arrows. The main
building is of crude brick, with beams laid horizontally between; the
base of the external rampart is nearly vertical, while the upper part
forms an angle of some seventy degrees with the horizon, making the
scaling of it, if not impossible, at least very difficult. Each of the
enclosing walls of the two fortresses surrounded a town complete in
itself, with temples dedicated to their founders and to the Nubian
deities, as well as numerous habitations, now in ruins. The sudden
widening of the river immediately to the south of the rapids made a
kind of natural roadstead, where the Egyptian squadron could lie without
danger on the eve of a campaign against Ethiopia; the galiots of the
negroes there awaited permission to sail below the rapids, and to
enter Egypt with their cargoes. At once a military station and a river
custom-house, Semneh was the necessary bulwark of the new Egypt, and
Usirtasen III. emphatically proclaimed the fact, in two decrees, which
he set up there for the edification of posterity. "Here is," so runs the
first, "the southern boundary fixed in the year VIII. under his Holiness
of Khâkerî, Usirtasen, who gives life always and for ever, in order that
none of the black peoples may cross it from above, except only for the
transport of animals, oxen, goats, and sheep belonging to them." The
edict of the year XVI. reiterates the prohibition of the year VIII.,
and adds that "His Majesty caused his own statue to be erected at the
landmarks which he himself had set up." The beds of the first and second
cataracts were then less worn away than they are now; they are therefore
more efficacious in keeping back the water and forcing it to rise to a
higher level above. The cataracts acted as indicators of the inundation,
and if their daily rise and fall were studied, it was possible to
announce to the dwellers on the banks lower down the river the progress
and probable results of the flood.

<p>
As long as the dominion of the Pharaohs reached no further than Philæ,
observations of the Nile were always taken at the first cataract; and
it was from Elephantine that Egypt received the news of the first
appearance and progress of the inundation. Amenemhâît III. set up a
new nilometer at the new frontier, and gave orders to his officers to
observe the course of the flood. They obeyed him scrupulously, and every
time that the inundation appeared to them to differ from the average
of ordinary years, they marked its height on the rocks of Semneh and
Kummeh, engraving side by side with the figure the name of the king and
the date of the year. The custom was continued there under the XIIIth
dynasty; afterwards, when the frontier was pushed further south, the
nilometer accompanied it.
</p>
<p>
The country beyond Semneh was virgin territory, almost untouched and
quite uninjured by previous wars. Its name now appears for the first
time upon the monuments, in the form of Kaûshû&mdash;the humbled Kûsh. It
comprised the districts situated to the south within the immense loop
described by the river between Dongola and Khartoum, those vast plains
intersected by the windings of the White and Blue Niles, known as the
regions of Kordofan and Darfur; it was bounded by the mountains of
Abyssinia, the marshes of Lake Nû, and all those semi-fabulous countries
to which were relegated the "Isles of the Manes" and the "Lands of
Spirits." It was separated from the Red Sea by the land of Pûanît; and
to the west, between it and the confines of the world, lay the Timihû.
Scores of tribes, white, copper-coloured, and black, bearing strange
names, wrangled over the possession of this vaguely defined territory;
some of them were still savage or emerging from barbarism, while others
had attained to a pitch of material civilization almost comparable with
that of Egypt. The same diversity of types, the same instability and the
same want of intelligence which characterized the tribes of those days,
still distinguish the medley of peoples who now frequent the upper
valley of the Nile. They led the same sort of animal life, guided by
impulse, and disturbed, owing to the caprices of their petty chiefs, by
bloody wars which often issued in slavery or in emigration to distant
regions.

<p>
With such shifting and unstable conditions, it would be difficult to
build up a permanent State. From time to time some kinglet, more daring,
cunning, tenacious, or better fitted to govern than the rest, extended
his dominion over his neighbours, and advanced step by step, till he
united immense tracts under his single rule. As by degrees his kingdom
enlarged, he made no efforts to organize it on any regular system, to
introduce any uniformity in the administration of its affairs, or to
gain the adherence of its incongruous elements by just laws which would
be equally for the good of all: when the massacres which accompanied his
first victories were over, when he had incorporated into his own army
what was left of the vanquished troops, when their children were led
into servitude and he had filled his treasury with their spoil and his
harem with their women, it never occurred to him that there was anything
more to be done. If he had acted otherwise, it would not probably have
been to his advantage. Both his former and present subjects were too
divergent in language and origin, too widely separated by manners and
customs, and too long in a state of hostility to each other, to draw
together and to become easily welded into a single nation. As soon as
the hand which held them together relaxed its hold for a moment, discord
crept in everywhere, among individuals as well as among the tribes, and
the empire of yesterday resolved itself into its original elements
even more rapidly than it had been formed. The clash of arms which had
inaugurated its brief existence died quickly away, the remembrance of
its short-lived glory was lost after two or three generations in the
horrors of a fresh invasion: its name vanished without leaving a trace
behind. The occupation of Nubia brought Egypt into contact with this
horde of incongruous peoples, and the contact soon entailed a struggle.
It is futile for a civilized state to think of dwelling peacefully with
any barbarous nation with which it is in close proximity. Should it
decide to check its own advances, and impose limits upon itself which
it shall not pass over, its moderation is mistaken for feebleness and
impotence; the vanquished again take up the offensive, and either
force the civilized power to retire, or compel it to cross its former
boundary. The Pharaohs did not escape this inevitable consequence of
conquest: their southern frontier advanced continually higher and higher
up the Nile, without ever becoming fixed in a position sufficiently
strong to defy the attacks of the Barbarians. Usirtasen I. had subdued
the countries of Hahû, of Khonthanunofir, and Shaad, and had beaten in
battle the Shemîk, the Khasa, the Sus, the Aqîn, the Anu, the Sabiri,
and the people of Akîti and Makisa. Amenemhâît II., Usirtasen II., and
Usirtasen III. never hesitated to "strike the humbled Kush" whenever
the opportunity presented itself. The last-mentioned king in particular
chastised them severely in his VIIIth, XIIth, XVIth, and XIXth years,
and his victories made him so popular, that the Egyptians of the Greek
period, identifying him with the Sesostris of Herodotus, attributed to
him the possession of the universe. On the base of a colossal statue of
rose granite which he erected in the temple of Tanis, we find preserved
a list of the tribes which he conquered: the names of them appear to
us most outlandish&mdash;Alaka, Matakaraû, Tûrasû, Pamaîka, Uarakî,
Paramakâ&mdash;and we have no clue as to their position on the map. We know
merely that they lived in the desert, on both sides of the Nile, in the
latitude of Berber or thereabouts. Similar expeditions were sent after
Ûsirtasen's time, and Amenem-hâît III. regarded both banks of the Nile,
between Semneh and Dongola, as forming part of the territory of Egypt
proper. Little by little, and by the force of circumstances, the making
of Greater Egypt was realized; she approached nearer and nearer towards
the limit which had been prescribed for her by nature, to that point
where the Nile receives its last tributaries, and where its peerless
valley takes its origin in the convergence of many others.
</p>
<p>
The conquest of Nubia was on the whole an easy one, and so much personal
advantage accrued from these wars, that the troops and generals entered
on them without the least repugnance. A single fragment has come down to
us which contains a detailed account of one of these campaigns, probably
that conducted by Usirtasen III. in the XVIth year of his reign. The
Pharaoh had received information that the tribes of the district of
Hûâ, on the Tacazze, were harassing his vassals, and possibly also
those Egyptians who were attracted by commerce to that neighbourhood.
He resolved to set out and chastise them severely, and embarked with
his fleet. It was an expedition almost entirely devoid of danger:
the invaders landed only at favourable spots, carried off any of the
inhabitants who came in their way, and seized on their cattle&mdash;on one
occasion as many as a hundred and twenty-three oxen and eleven asses, on
others less. Two small parties marched along the banks, and foraging to
the right and left, drove the booty down to the river. The tactics of
invasion have scarcely undergone any change in these countries;
the account given by Cailliaud of the first conquest of Fazogl by
Ismail-Pasha, in 1822, might well serve to complete the fragments of
the inscription of Usirtasen III., and restore for us, almost in every
detail, a faithful picture of the campaigns carried on in these regions
by the kings of the XIIth dynasty. The people are hunted down in
the same fashion; the country is similarly ravaged by a handful of
well-armed, fairly disciplined men attacking naked and disconnected
hordes, the young men are massacred after a short resistance or forced
to escape into the woods, the women are carried off as slaves, the huts
pillaged, villages burnt, whole tribes exterminated in a few hours.
Sometimes a detachment, having imprudently ventured into some thorny
thicket to attack a village perched on a rocky summit, would experience
a reverse, and would with great difficulty regain the main body of
troops, after having lost three-fourths of its men. In most cases there
was no prolonged resistance, and the attacking party carried the place
with the loss of merely two or three men killed or wounded. The spoil
was never very considerable in any one locality, but its total amount
increased as the raid was carried afield, and it soon became so bulky
that the party had to stop and retrace their steps, in order to place
it for safety in the nearest fortress. The booty consisted for the most
part of herds of oxen and of cumbrous heaps of grain, as well as wood
for building purposes. But it also comprised objects of small size but
of great value, such as ivory, precious stones, and particularly gold.
The natives collected the latter in the alluvial tracts watered by the
Tacazze, the Blue Nile and its tributaries. The women were employed
in searching for nuggets, which were often of considerable size; they
enclosed them in little leather cases, and offered them to the merchants
in exchange for products of Egyptian industry, or they handed them over
to the goldsmiths to be made into bracelets, ear, nose, or finger rings,
of fairly fine workmanship. Gold was found in combination with several
other metals, from which they did not know how to separate it: the
purest gold had a pale yellow tint, which was valued above all others,
but electrum, that is to say, gold alloyed with silver in the proportion
of eighty per cent., was also much in demand, while greyish-coloured
gold, mixed with platinum, served for making common jewellery.*

     * Cailliaud has briefly described the auriferous sand of the
     Qamâmyl, and the way in which it is worked: it is from him
     that I have borrowed the details given in the text. From
     analyses which I caused to be made at the Bûlaq Museum of
     Egyptian jewellery of the time of the XVIIIth dynasty, which
     had been broken and were without value, from an archeo-
     logical or artistic point of view, I have demonstrated the
     presence of the platinum and silver mentioned by Cailliaud
     as being found in the nuggets from the Blue Nile.
</pre>
<p>
None of these expeditions produced any lasting results, and the Pharaohs
established no colonies in any of these countries. Their Egyptian
subjects could not have lived there for any length of time without
deteriorating by intermarriage with the natives or from the effects of
the climate; they would have degenerated into a half-bred race, having
all the vices and none of the good qualities of the aborigines. The
Pharaohs, therefore, continued their hostilities without further
scruples, and only sought to gain as much as possible from their
victories. They cared little if nothing remained after they had passed
through some district, or if the passage of their armies was marked
only by ruins. They seized upon everything which came across their
path&mdash;men, chattels, or animals&mdash;and carried them back to Egypt; they
recklessly destroyed everything for which they had no use, and made a
desert of fertile districts which but yesterday had been covered with
crops and studded with populous villages. The neighbouring inhabitants,
realizing their incapacity to resist regular troops, endeavoured to buy
off the invaders by yielding up all they possessed in the way of slaves,
flocks, wood, or precious metals. The generals in command, however, had
to reckon with the approaching low Nile, which forced them to beat a
retreat; they were obliged to halt at the first appearance of it, and
they turned homewards "in peace," their only anxiety being to lose the
smallest possible number of men or captured animals on their return
journey.
</p>
<p>
As in earlier times, adventurous merchants penetrated into districts not
reached by the troops, and prepared the way for conquest. The princes
of Elephantine still sent caravans to distant parts, and one of them,
Siranpîtû, who lived under Ûsirtasen I. and Amenemhâit II., recorded his
explorations on his tomb, after the fashion of his ancestors: the king
at several different times had sent him on expeditions to the Soudan,
but the inscription in which he gives an account of them is so
mutilated, that we cannot be sure which tribes he visited. We
learn merely that he collected from them skins, ivory, ostrich
feathers&mdash;everything, in fact, which Central Africa has furnished as
articles of commerce from time immemorial. It was not, however, by
land only that Egyptian merchants travelled to seek fortune in foreign
countries: the Red Sea attracted them, and served as a quick route for
reaching the land of Pûanît, whose treasures in perfumes and rarities
of all kinds had formed the theme of ancient traditions and navigators'
tales. Relations with it had been infrequent, or had ceased altogether,
during the wars of the Heracleo-politan period: on their renewal it
was necessary to open up afresh routes which had been forgotten for
centuries.

Traffic was confined almost entirely to two or three out of the

Nekhabît," the Berenice of the Greeks; others which started from Thebes
or Koptos, and struck the coast at the same place or at Saû, the present

quarry the stone often took advantage of the opportunity to visit the
coast, and to penetrate as far as the Spice Regions. As early as the
year VIII. of Sônkherî, the predecessor of Amenemhâît I., the "sole
friend" Hûnû had been sent by this road, "in order to take the command
of a squadron to Pûanît, and to collect a tribute of fresh incense
from the princes of the desert." He got together three thousand men,
distributed to each one a goatskin bottle, a crook for carrying it, and
ten loaves, and set out from Koptos with this little army. No water was
met with on the way: Hûnû bored several wells and cisterns in the rock,
one at a halting-place called Bait, two in the district of Adahaît, and
finally one in the valleys of Adabehaît. Having reached the seaboard,
he quickly constructed a great barge, freighted it with merchandise for
barter, as well as with provisions, oxen, cows, and goats, and set sail
for a cruise along the coast: it is not known how far he went, but he
came back with a large cargo of all the products of the "Divine Land,"
especially of incense. On his return, he struck off into the Uagai
valley, and thence reached that of Rohanû, where he chose out splendid
blocks of stone for a temple which the king was building: "Never had
'Royal Cousin' sent on an expedition done as much since the time of
the god Râ!" Numbers of royal officers and adventurers followed in his
footsteps, but no record of them has been preserved for us. Two or three
names only have escaped oblivion&mdash;that of Khnûmhotpû, who in the first
year of Ûsirtasen I. erected a stele in the Wady Gasûs in the very heart
of the "Divine Land;" and that of Khentkhîtioîrû, who in the XXVIIIth
year of Amenemhâît II. entered the haven of Saû after a fortunate cruise
to Pûanît, without having lost a vessel or even a single man. Navigation
is difficult in the Red Sea. The coast as a rule is precipitous,
bristling with reefs and islets, and almost entirely without strand or
haven. No river or stream runs into it; it is bordered by no fertile or
wooded tract, but by high cliffs, half disintegrated by the burning sun,
or by steep mountains, which appear sometimes a dull red, sometimes
a dingy grey colour, according to the material&mdash;granite or
sandstone&mdash;which predominates in their composition. The few tribes who
inhabit this desolate region maintain a miserable existence by fishing
and hunting: they were considered, during the Greek period, to be
the most unfortunate of mortals, and if they appeared to be so to the
mariners of the Ptolemies, doubtless they enjoyed the same reputation in
the more remote time of the Pharaohs. A few fishing villages, however,
are mentioned as scattered along the littoral; watering-places, at some
distance apart, frequented on account of their wells of brackish water
by the desert tribes: such were Nahasît, Tap-Nekhabît, Saû, and Tâû:
these the Egyptian merchant-vessels used as victualling stations,
and took away as cargo the products of the country&mdash;mother-of-pearl,
amethysts, emeralds, a little lapis-lazuli, a little gold, gums, and
sweet-smelling resins. If the weather was favourable, and the intake
of merchandise had been scanty, the vessel, braving numerous risks of
shipwreck, continued its course as far as the latitude of Sûakîn and
Massowah, which was the beginning of Pûanît properly so called. Here
riches poured down to the coast from the interior, and selection became
a difficulty: it was hard to decide which would make the best cargo,
ivory or ebony, panthers' skins or rings of gold, myrrh, incense, or a
score of other sweet-smelling gums. So many of these odoriferous resins
were used for religious purposes, that it was always to the advantage of
the merchant to procure as much of them as possible: incense, fresh or
dried, was the staple and characteristic merchandise of the Red Sea, and
the good people of Egypt pictured Pûanît as a land of perfumes, which
attracted the sailor from afar by the delicious odours which were wafted
from it.
</p>
<p>
These voyages were dangerous and trying: popular imagination seized upon
them and made material out of them for marvellous tales. The hero chosen
was always a daring adventurer sent by his master to collect gold from
the mines of Nubia; by sailing further and further up the river, he
reached the mysterious sea which forms the southern boundary of the
world. "I set sail in a vessel one hundred and fifty cubits long, forty
wide, with one hundred and fifty of the best sailors in the land
of Egypt, who had seen heaven and earth, and whose hearts were more
resolute than those of lions. They had foretold that the wind would not
be contrary, or that there would be even none at all; but a squall came
upon us unexpectedly while we were in the open, and as we approached
the land, the wind freshened and raised the waves to the height of eight
cubits. As for me, I clung to a beam, but those who were on the vessel
perished without one escaping. A wave of the sea cast me on to an
island, after having spent three days alone with no other companion than
my own heart. I slept there in the shade of a thicket; then I set my
legs in motion in quest of something for my mouth." The island produced
a quantity of delicious fruit: he satisfied his hunger with it, lighted
a fire to offer a sacrifice to the gods, and immediately, by the magical
power of the sacred rites, the inhabitants, who up to this time had
been invisible, were revealed to his eyes. "I heard a sound like that of
thunder, which I at first took to be the noise of the flood-tide in the
open sea; but the trees quivered, the earth trembled. I uncovered my
face, and I perceived that it was a serpent which was approaching. He
was thirty cubits in length, and his wattles exceeded two cubits; his
body was incrusted with gold, and his colour appeared like that of
real lapis. He raised himself before me and opened his mouth; while I
prostrated myself before him, he said to me: 'Who hath brought thee, who
hath brought thee, little one, who hath brought thee? If thou dost not
tell me immediately who brought thee to this island, I will cause thee
to know thy littleness: either thou shalt faint like a woman, or thou
shalt tell me something which I have not yet heard, and which I knew
not before thee.' Then he took me into his mouth and carried me to
his dwelling-place, and put me down without hurting me; I was safe and
sound, and nothing had been taken from me." Our hero tells the serpent
the story of his shipwreck, which moves him to pity and induces him to
reciprocate his confidence. "Fear nothing, fear nothing, little one, let
not thy countenance be sad! If thou hast come to me, it is the god who
has spared thy life; it is he who has brought thee into this 'Isle of
the Double,' where nothing is lacking, and which is filled with all
good things. Here thou shalt pass one month after another till thou hast
remained four months in this island, then shall come a vessel from thy
country with mariners; thou canst depart with them to thy country,
and thou shalt die in thy city. To converse rejoices the heart, he who
enjoys conversation bears misfortune better; I will therefore relate
to thee the history of this island." The population consisted of
seventy-five serpents, all of one family: it formerly comprised also a
young girl, whom a succession of misfortunes had cast on the island, and
who was killed by lightning. The hero, charmed with such good nature,
overwhelmed the hospitable dragon with thanks, and promised to send him
numerous presents on his return home. "I will slay asses for thee in
sacrifice, I will pluck birds for thee, I will send to thee vessels
filled with all the riches of Egypt, meet for a god, the friend of man
in a distant country unknown to men." The monster smiled, and replied
that it was needless to think of sending presents to one who was the
ruler of Pûanît; besides, "as soon as thou hast quitted this place,
thou wilt never again see this island, for it will be changed into
waves."&mdash;"And then, when the vessel appeared, according as he had
predicted to me, I went and perched upon a high tree and sought to
distinguish those who manned it. I next ran to tell him the news, but I
found that he was already informed of its arrival, and he said to me: 'A
pleasant journey home, little one; mayst thou behold thy children again,
and may thy name be well spoken of in thy town; such are my wishes for
thee!' He added gifts to these obliging words. I placed all these on
board the vessel which had come, and prostrating myself, I adored him.
He said to me: 'After two months thou shalt reach thy country, thou wilt
press thy children to thy bosom, and thou shalt rest in thy sepulchre.'
After that I descended the shore to the vessel, and I hailed the sailors
who were in it. I gave thanks on the shore to the master of the island,
as well as to those who dwelt in it." This might almost be an episode
in the voyages of Sindbad the Sailor; except that the monsters which
Sindbad met with in the course of his travels were not of such a kindly
disposition as the Egyptian serpent: it did not occur to them to console
the shipwrecked with the charm of a lengthy gossip, but they swallowed
them with a healthy appetite. Putting aside entirely the marvellous
element in the story, what strikes us is the frequency of the relations
which it points to between Egypt and Pûanît. The appearance of an
Egyptian vessel excites no astonishment on its coasts: the inhabitants
have already seen many such, and at such regular intervals, that they
are able to predict the exact date of their arrival. The distance
between the two countries, it is true, was not considerable, and a
voyage of two months was sufficient to accomplish it. While the new
Egypt was expanding outwards in all directions, the old country did not
cease to add to its riches. The two centuries during which the XIIth
dynasty continued to rule were a period of profound peace; the monuments
show us the country in full possession of all its resources and its
arts, and its inhabitants both cheerful and contented. More than ever do
the great lords and royal officers expatiate in their epitaphs upon
the strict justice which they have rendered to their vassals and
subordinates, upon the kindness which they have shown to the fellahîn,
on the paternal solicitude with which, in the years of insufficient
inundations or of bad harvests, they have striven to come forward and
assist them, and upon the unheard-of disinterestedness which kept them
from raising the taxes during the times of average Niles, or of unusual
plenty. Gifts to the gods poured in from one end of the country to the
other, and the great building works, which had been at a standstill
since the end of the VIth dynasty, were recommenced simultaneously on
all sides. There was much to be done in the way of repairing the ruins,
of which the number had accumulated during the two preceding centuries.
Not that the most audacious kings had ventured to lay their hands on
the sanctuaries: they emptied the sacred treasuries, and partially
confiscated their revenues, but when once their cupidity was satisfied,
they respected the fabrics, and even went so far as to restore a
few inscriptions, or, when needed, to replace a few stones. These
magnificent buildings required careful supervision: in spite of their
being constructed of the most durable materials&mdash;sand-stone, granite,
limestone,&mdash;in spite of their enormous size, or of the strengthening
of their foundations by a bed of sand and by three or four courses of
carefully adjusted blocks to form a substructure, the Nile was ever
threatening them, and secretly working at their destruction. Its waters,
filtering through the soil, were perpetually in contact with the lower
courses of these buildings, and kept the foundations of the walls and
the bases of the columns constantly damp: the saltpetre which the waters
had dissolved in their passage, crystallising on the limestone, would
corrode and undermine everything, if precautions were not taken. When
the inundation was over, the subsidence of the water which impregnated
the subsoil caused in course of time settlements in the most solid
foundations: the walls, disturbed by the unequal sinking of the ground,
got out of the perpendicular and cracked; this shifting displaced the
architraves which held the columns together, and the stone slabs which
formed the roof. These disturbances, aggravated from year to year, were
sufficient, if not at once remedied, to entail the fall of the portions
attacked; in addition to this, the Nile, having threatened the part
below with destruction, often hastened by direct attacks the work of
ruin, which otherwise proceeded slowly. A breach in the embankments
protecting the town or the temple allowed its waters to rush violently
through, and thus to effect large gaps in the decaying walls, completing
the overthrow of the columns and wrecking the entrance halls and secret
chambers by the fall of the roofs. At the time when Egypt came under
the rule of the XIIth dynasty there were but few cities which did not
contain some ruined or dilapidated sanctuary. Amenemhâît I., although
fully occupied in reducing the power of the feudal lords, restored; the
temples as far as he was able, and his successors pushed forward the
work vigorously for nearly two centuries.
</p>
<p>
The Delta profited greatly by this activity in building. The monuments
there had suffered more than anywhere else: fated to bear the first
shock of foreign invasion, and transformed into fortresses while the
towns in which they were situated were besieged, they have been captured
again and again by assault, broken down by attacking engines, and
dismantled by all the conquerors of Egypt, from the Assyrians to the
Arabs and the Turks. The fellahîn in their neighbourhood have for
centuries come to them to obtain limestone to burn in their kilns, or to
use them as a quarry for sandstone or granite for the doorways of their
houses, or for the thresholds of their mosques. Not only have they been
ruined, but the remains of their ruins have, as it were, melted away
and almost entirely disappeared in the course of ages. And yet, wherever
excavations have been made among these remains which have suffered such
deplorable ill-treatment, colossi and inscriptions commemorating the
Pharaohs of the XIIth dynasty have been brought to light. Amenemhâît I.
founded a great temple at Tanis in honour of the gods of Memphis: the
vestiges of the columns still scattered on all sides show that the
main body of the building was of rose granite, and a statue of the same
material has preserved for us a portrait of the king. He is seated, and
wears the tall head-dress of Osiris. He has a large smiling face, thick
lips, a short nose, and big staring eyes: the expression is one of
benevolence and gentleness, rather than of the energy and firmness which
one would expect in the founder of a dynasty. The kings who were his
successors all considered it a privilege to embellish the temple and to
place in it some memorial of their veneration for the god. Ûsirtasen I.,
following the example of his father, set up a statue of himself in the
form of Osiris: he is sitting on his throne of grey granite, and his
placid face unmistakably recalls that of Amenemhâît I. Amenemhâît II.,
Usirtasen II., and his wife Nofrît have also dedicated their images
within the sanctuary.
</p>
<p>
Nofrît's is of black granite: her head is almost eclipsed by the heavy
Hâthor wig, consisting of two enormous tresses of hair which surround
the cheeks, and lie with an outward curve upon the breast; her eyes,
which were formerly inlaid, have fallen out, the bronze eyelids are
lost, her arms have almost disappeared. What remains of her, however,
gives us none the less the impression of a young and graceful woman,
with a lithe and well-proportioned body, whose outlines are delicately
modelled under the tight-fitting smock worn by Egyptian women; the small
and rounded breasts curve outward between the extremities of her curls
and the embroidered hem of her garment; and a pectoral bearing the name
of her husband lies flat upon her chest, just below the column of her
throat.

the Museum at Gîzeh possesses a torso 
from the same source. I believe I can

granite, which has been in the Museum at
Marseilles since the beginning of the 
present century.
</pre>
<p>
These various statues have all an evident artistic relationship to
the beautiful granite figures of the Ancient Empire. The sculptors who
executed them belonged to the same school as those who carved Khephren
out of the solid diorite: there is the same facile use of the chisel,
the same indifference to the difficulties presented by the material
chosen, the same finish in the detail, the same knowledge of the human
form. One is almost tempted to believe that Egyptian art remained
unchanged all through those long centuries, and yet as soon as a
statue of the early period is placed side by side with one of the XIIth
dynasty, we immediately perceive something in the one which is lacking
in the other. It is a difference in feeling, even if the technique
remains unmodified. It was the man himself that the sculptors desired
to represent in the older Pharaohs, and however haughty may be the
countenance which we admire in the Khephren, it is the human element
which predominates in him. The statues of Amenemhâît I. and his
successors appear, on the contrary, to represent a superior race: at the
time when these were produced, the Pharaoh had long been regarded as
a god, and the divine nature in him had almost eliminated the human.
Whether intentionally or otherwise, the sculptors idealized their model,
and made him more and more resemble the type of the divinities. The head
always appears to be a good likeness, but smoothed down and sometimes
lacking in expression.
</p>
<p>
Not only are the marks of age rendered less apparent, and the features
made to bear the stamp of perpetual youth, but the characteristics
of the individual, such as the accentuation of the eyebrows, the
protuberance of the cheek-bones, the projection of the under lip, are
all softened down as if intentionally, and made to give way to a uniform
expression of majestic tranquillity. One king only, Amenemhâît III.,
refused to go down to posterity thus effaced, and caused his portrait
to be taken as he really was. He has certainly the round full face
of Amenemhâît or of Usirtasen I., and there is an undeniable family
likeness between him and his ancestors; but at the first glance we
feel sure that the artist has not in any way flattered his model. The
forehead is low and slightly retreating, narrow across the temples; his
nose is aquiline, pronounced in form, and large at the tip; the thick
lips are slightly closed; his mouth has a disdainful curve, and its
corners are turned down as if to repress the inevitable smile common to
most Egyptian statues; the chin is full and heavy, and turns up in front
in spite of the weight of the false beard dependent from it; he has
small narrow eyes, with full lids; his cheekbones are accentuated and
projecting, the cheeks hollow, and the muscles about the nose and mouth
strongly defined. The whole presents so strange an aspect, that for a
long time statues of this type have been persistently looked upon as
productions of an art which was only partially Egyptian. It is, indeed,
possible that the Tanis sphinxes were turned out of workshops where the
principles and practice of the sculptor's art had previously undergone
some Asiatic influence; the bushy mane which surrounds the face, and
the lion's ears emerging from it, are exclusively characteristic of the
latter. The purely human statues in which we meet with the same type of
countenance have no peculiarity of workmanship which could be attributed
to the imitation of a foreign art. If the nameless masters to whom
we owe their existence desired to bring about a reaction against the
conventional technique of their contemporaries, they at least introduced
no foreign innovations; the monuments of the Memphite period furnished
them with all the models they could possibly wish for.
</p>
<p>
Bubastis had no less occasion than Tanis to boast of the generosity of
the Theban Pharaohs. The temple of Bastît, which had been decorated by
Kheops and Khephren, was still in existence: Amenemhâît I., Usirtasen
I., and their immediate successors confined themselves to the
restoration of several chambers, and to the erection of their own
statues, but Usirtasen III. added to it a new structure which must have
made it rival the finest monuments in Egypt. He believed, no doubt, that
he was under particular obligations to the lioness goddess of the city,
and attributed to her aid, for unknown reasons, some of his successes in
Nubia; it would appear that it was with the spoil of a campaign against
the country of the Hûâ that he endowed a part of the new sanctuary.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The fragment found by Naville formed part of an
     inscription engraved on a wall: the wars which it was
     customary to commemorate in a temple were always selected
     from those in which the whole or a part of the booty had
     been consecrated to the use of the local divinity.
</pre>
<p>
Nothing now remains of it except fragments of the architraves and
granite columns, which have been used over again by Pharaohs of a later
period when restoring or altering the fabric.

A few of the columns belong to the lotiform type. The shaft is composed
of eight triangular stalks rising from a bunch of leaves, symmetrically
arranged, and bound together at the top by a riband, twisted thrice
round the bundle; the capital is formed by the union of the eight lotus
buds, surmounted by a square member on which rests the architrave. Other
columns have Hâthor-headed capitals, the heads being set back to back,
and bearing the flat head-dress ornamented with the urous. The face
of the goddess, which is somewhat flattened when seen closely on the
eye-level, stands out and becomes more lifelike in proportion as the
spectator recedes from it; the projection of the features has been
calculated so as to produce the desired effect at the right height
when seen from below. The district lying between Tanis and Bubastis is
thickly studded with monuments built or embellished by the Amenemhâîts
and Usirtasens: wherever the pickaxe is applied, whether at Fakus or
Tell-Nebêsheh, remains of them are brought to light&mdash;statues, stelæ,
tables of offerings, and fragments of dedicatory or historical
inscriptions. While carrying on works in the temple of Phtah at Memphis,
the attention of these Pharaohs was attracted to Heliopolis. The temple
of Râ there was either insufficient for the exigencies of worship, or
had been allowed to fall into decay. Usirtasen III. resolved, in the
third year of his reign, to undertake its restoration. The occasion
appears to have been celebrated as a festival by all Egypt, and the
remembrance of it lasted long after the event: the somewhat detailed
account of the ceremonies which then took place was copied out again at
Thebes, towards the end of the XVIIIth dynasty. It describes the king
mounting his throne at the meeting of his council, and receiving, as was
customary, the eulogies of his "sole friends" and of the courtiers
who surrounded him: "Here," says he, addressing them, "has my Majesty
ordained the works which shall recall my worthy and noble acts to
posterity. I raise a monument, I establish lasting decrees in favour
of Harmakhis, for he has brought me into the world to do as he did, to
accomplish that which he decreed should be done; he has appointed me to
guide this earth, he has known it, he has called it together and he has
granted me his help; I have caused the Eye which is in him to become
serene, in all things acting as he would have me to do, and I have
sought out that which he had resolved should be known. I am a king by
birth, a suzerain not of my own making; I have governed from childhood,
petitions have been presented to me when I was in the egg, I have ruled
over the ways of Anubis, and he raised me up to be master of the two
halves of the world, from the time when I was a nursling; I had not yet
escaped from the swaddling-bands when he enthroned me as master of men;
creating me himself in the sight of mortals, he made me to find favour
with the Dweller in the Palace, when I was a youth.... I came forth as
Horus the eloquent, and I have instituted divine oblations; I accomplish
the works in the palace of my father Atûmû, I supply his altar on earth
with offerings, I lay the foundations of my palace in his neighbourhood,
in order that the memorial of my goodness may remain in his dwelling;
for this palace is my name, this lake is my monument, all that is famous
or useful that I have made for the gods is eternity." The great lords
testified their approbation of the king's piety; the latter summoned his
chancellor and commanded him to draw up the deeds of gift and all the
documents necessary for the carrying out of his wishes. "He arose,
adorned with the royal circlet and with the double feather, followed by
all his nobles; the chief lector of the divine book stretched the cord
and fixed the stake in the ground."*

     i. 11. 13&mdash;15. The priest here performed with the king the
     more important of the ceremonies necessary in measuring the
     area of the temple, by "inserting the measuring stakes,"
     and marking out the four sides of the building with the
     cord.
</pre>
<p>
This temple has ceased to exist; but one of the granite obelisks raised
by Usirtasen I. on each side of the principal gateway is still standing.
The whole of Heliopolis has disappeared: the site where it formerly
stood is now marked only by a few almost imperceptible inequalities
in the soil, some crumbling lengths of walls, and here and there some
scattered blocks of limestone, containing a few lines of mutilated
inscriptions which can with difficulty be deciphered; the obelisk has
survived even the destruction of the ruins, and to all who understand
its language it still speaks of the Pharaoh who erected it.
</p>
<p>
The undertaking and successful completion of so many great structures
had necessitated a renewal of the working of the ancient quarries, and
the opening of fresh ones. Amenemhâît I. sent Antuf, a great dignitary,
chief of the prophets of Mînû and prince of Koptos, to the valley
of Rohanû, to seek out fine granite for making the royal sarcophagi.
Amenemhâît III. had, in the XLIIIrd year of his reign, been present at
the opening of several fine veins of white limestone in the quarries of
Turah, which probably furnished material for the buildings proceeding at
Heliopolis and Memphis. Thebes had also its share of both limestone and
granite, and Amon, whose sanctuary up to this time had only attained
the modest proportions suited to a provincial god, at last possessed a
temple which raised him to the rank of the highest feudal divinities.
Amon's career had begun under difficulties: he had been merely a
vassal-god of Montû, lord of Hermonthis (the Aûnû of the south), who
had granted to him the ownership of the village of Karnak only. The
unforeseen good fortune of the Antufs was the occasion of his emerging
from his obscurity: he did not dethrone Montû, but shared with him the
homage of all the neighbouring villages&mdash;Luxor, Medamut, Bayadîyeh; and,
on the other side of the Nile, Gurneh and Medînet-Habu. The accession of
the XIIth dynasty completed his triumph, and made him the most powerful
authority in Southern Egypt. He was an earth-god, a form of Mînû who
reigned at Koptos, at Akhmîm and in the desert, but he soon became
allied to the sun, and from thenceforth he assumed the name of Amon-Râ.
The title of "sûton nûtîrû" which he added to it would alone have
sufficed to prove the comparatively recent origin of his notoriety; as
the latest arrival among the great gods, he employed, to express his
sovereignty, this word "sûton," king, which had designated the rulers
of the valley ever since the union of the two Egypts under the shadowy
Menés. Reigning at first alone, he became associated by marriage with a
vague indefinite goddess, called Maût, or Mût, the "mother," who never
adopted any more distinctive name: the divine son who completed
this triad was, in early times, Montû; but in later times a being of
secondary rank, chosen from among the genii appointed to watch over the
days of the month or the stars, was added, under the name of Khonsû.
Amenemhâît laid the foundations of the temple, in which the cultus of
Amon was carried on down to the latest times of paganism. The building
was supported by polygonal columns of sixteen sides, some fragments of
which are still existing.

The temple was at first of only moderate dimensions, but it was built
of the choicest sandstone and limestone, and decorated with exquisite
bas-reliefs. Ûsirtasen I. enlarged it, and built a beautiful house for
the high priest on the west side of the sacred lake. Luxor, Zorit, Edfu,

Its reputation for sanctity had been steadily growing from the time of
the Papis: its god, Khontamentît, who was identified with Osiris, had
obtained in the south a rank as high as that of the Mendesian Osiris in
the north of Egypt. He was worshipped as the sovereign of the sovereigns
of the dead&mdash;he who gathered around him and welcomed in his domains
the majority of the faithful of other cults. His sepulchre, or, more
correctly speaking, the chapel representing his sepulchre, in which
one of his relics was preserved, was here, as elsewhere, built upon the
roof. Access to it was gained by a staircase leading up on the left side
of the sanctuary: on the days of the passion and resurrection of Osiris
solemn processions of priests and devotees slowly mounted its steps, to
the chanting of funeral hymns, and above, on the terrace, away from
the world of the living, and with no other witnesses than the stars of
heaven, the faithful celebrated mysteriously the rites of the divine
death and embalming. The "vassals of Osiris" flocked in crowds to these
festivals, and took a delight in visiting, at least once during their
lifetime, the city whither their souls would proceed after death, in
order to present themselves at the "Mouth of the Cleft," there to embark
in the "bari" of their divine master or in that of the Sun. They
left behind them, "under the staircase of the great god," a sort of
fictitious tomb, near the representation of the tomb of Osiris, in the
shape of a stele, which immortalized the memory of their piety, and
which served as a kind of hostelry for their soul, when the latter
should, in course of time, repair to this rallying-place of all
Osirian souls. The concourse of pilgrims was a source of wealth to
the population, the priestly coffers were filled, and every year the
original temple was felt to be more and more inadequate to meet the
requirements of worship. Usirtasen I. desired to come to the rescue:
he despatched Monthotpû, one of his great vassals, to superintend the
works. The ground-plan of the portico of white limestone which preceded
the entrance court may still be distinguished; this portico was
supported by square pillars, and, standing against the remains of these,
we see the colossi of rose granite, crowned with the Osirian head-dress,
and with their feet planted on the "Nine Bows," the symbol of vanquished
enemies. The best preserved of these figures represents the founder, but
several others are likenesses of those of his successors who interested
themselves in the temple. Monthotpû dug a well which was kept fully
supplied by the infiltrations from the Nile. He enlarged and cleaned
out the sacred lake upon which the priests launched the Holy Ark, on the
nights of the great mysteries. The alluvial deposits of fifty centuries
have not as yet wholly filled it up: it is still an irregularly shaped
pond, which dries up in winter, but is again filled as soon as the
inundation reaches the village of El-Kharbeh.

A few stones, corroded with saltpetre, mark here and there the lines
of the landing stages, a thick grove of palms fringes its northern and
southern banks, but to the west the prospect is open, and extends as
far as the entrance to the gorge, through which the souls set forth in
search of Paradise and the solar bark. Buffaloes now come to drink and
wallow at midday where once floated the gilded "bari" of Osiris, and the
murmur of bees from the neighbouring orchards alone breaks the silence
of the spot which of old resounded with the rhythmical lamentations of
the pilgrims.

<p>
Heracleopolis the Great, the town preferred by the earlier Theban
Pharaohs as their residence in times of peace, must have been one of
those which they proceeded to decorate <i>con amore</i> with magnificent
monuments.

Unfortunately it has suffered more than any of the rest, and nothing
of it is now to be seen but a few wretched remains of buildings of the
Roman period, and the ruins of a barbaric colonnade on the site of a
Byzantine basilica almost contemporary with the Arab conquest. Perhaps
the enormous mounds which cover its site may still conceal the remains
of its ancient temples. We can merely estimate their magnificence by
casual allusions to them in the inscriptions.

We know, for instance, that Usirtasen III. rebuilt the sanctuary of
Harshâfîtû, and that he sent expeditions to the Wady Hammamât to quarry
blocks of granite worthy of his god: but the work of this king and his
successors has perished in the total ruin of the ancient town. Something
at least has remained of what they did in that traditional dependency
of Heracleopolis, the Fayum: the temple which they rebuilt to the god
Sobkû in Shodît retained its celebrity down to the time of the Cæsars,
not so much, perhaps, on account of the beauty of its architecture as
for the unique character of the religious rites which took place there
daily. The sacred lake contained a family of tame crocodiles, the
image and incarnation of the god, whom the faithful fed with their
offerings&mdash;cakes, fried fish, and drinks sweetened with honey. Advantage
was taken of the moment when one of these creatures, wallowing on the
bank, basked contentedly in the sun: two priests opened his jaws, and a
third threw in the cakes, the fried morsels, and finally the liquid.
The crocodile bore all this without even winking; he swallowed down his
provender, plunged into the lake, and lazily reached the opposite bank,
hoping to escape for a few moments from the oppressive liberality of his
devotees.

As soon, however, as another of these approached, he was again beset
at his new post and stuffed in a similar manner. These animals were in
their own way great dandies: rings of gold or enamelled terra-cotta
were hung from their ears, and bracelets were soldered on to their front
paws. The monuments of Shodît, if any still exist, are buried under the
mounds of Medinet el-Fayûm, but in the neighbourhood we meet with more
than one authentic relic of the XIIth dynasty. It was Usirtasen I. who
erected that curious thin granite obelisk, with a circular top, whose
fragments lie forgotten on the ground near the village of Begig: a
sort of basin has been hollowed out around it, which fills during the
inundation, so that the monument lies in a pool of muddy water during
the greater part of the year. Owing to this treatment, most of the
inscriptions on it have almost disappeared, though we can still make
out a series of five scenes in which the king hands offerings to several
divinities. Near to Biahmû there was an old temple which had become
ruinous: Amenemhâît III. repaired it, and erected in front of it two
of those colossal statues which the Egyptians were wont to place like
sentinels at their gates, to ward off baleful influences and evil
spirits.
</p>



<p>
The colossi at Biahmû were of red sandstone, and were seated on high
limestone pedestals, placed at the end of a rectangular court; the
temple walls hid the lower part of the pedestals, so that the colossi
appeared to tower above a great platform which sloped gently away from
them on all sides. Herodotus, who saw them from a distance at the
time of the inundation, believed that they crowned the summits of
two pyramids rising out of the middle of a lake. Near Illahun, Queen
Sovkûnofriûri herself has left a few traces of her short reign.
</p>
<p>
The Fayum, by its fertility and pleasant climate, justified the
preference which the Pharaohs of the XIIth dynasty bestowed upon it.
On emerging from the gorges of Illahun, it opens out like a vast
amphitheatre of cultivation, whose slopes descend towards the north till
they reach the desolate waters of the Birket-Kerun.

<p>
On the right and left, the amphitheatre is isolated from the surrounding
mountains by two deep ravines, filled with willows, tamarisks, mimosas,
and thorny acacias. Upon the high ground, lands devoted to the
culture of corn, durra, and flax, alternate with groves of palms and
pomegranates, vineyards and gardens of olives, the latter being almost
unknown elsewhere in Egypt.

The slopes are covered with cultivated fields, irregularly terraced
woods, and meadows enclosed by hedges, while lofty trees, clustered in
some places and thinly scattered in others, rise in billowy masses
of verdure one behind the other. Shodît [Shâdû] stood on a peninsula
stretching out into a kind of natural reservoir, and was connected with
the mainland by merely a narrow dyke; the water of the inundation flowed
into this reservoir and was stored here during the autumn. Countless
little rivulets escaped from it, not merely such canals and ditches as
we meet with in the Nile Valley, but actual running brooks, coursing and
babbling between the trees, spreading out here and there into pools
of water, and in places forming little cascades like those of our own
streams, but dwindling in volume as they proceeded, owing to constant
drains made on them, until they were for the most part absorbed by the
soil before finally reaching the lake.

They brought down in their course part of the fertilizing earth
accumulated by the inundation, and were thus instrumental in raising the
level of the soil. The water of the Birkeh rose or fell according to the
season of the year. It formerly occupied a much larger area than it does
at present, and half of the surrounding districts was covered by it.
Its northern shores, now deserted and uncultivated, then shared in the
benefits of the inundation, and supplied the means of existence for
a civilized population. In many places we still find the remains of
villages, and walls of uncemented stone; a small temple even has
escaped the general ruin, and remains almost intact in the midst of the
desolation, as if to point out the furthest limit of Egyptian territory.

It bears no inscriptions, but the beauty of the materials of which it
is composed, and the perfection of the work, lead us to attribute its
construction to some prince of the XIIth dynasty. An ancient causeway
runs from its entrance to what was probably at one time the original
margin of the lake. The continual sinking of the level of the Birkeh
has left this temple isolated on the edge of the Libyan plateau, and
all life has retired from the surrounding district, and has concentrated
itself on the southern shores of the lake.

Here the banks are low and the bottom deepens almost imperceptibly. In
winter the retreating waters leave exposed long patches of the shore,
upon which a thin crust of snow-white salt is deposited, concealing the
depths of mud and quicksands beneath. Immediately after the inundation,
the lake regains in a few days the ground it had lost: it encroaches
on the tamarisk bushes which fringe its banks, and the district is soon
surrounded by a belt of marshy vegetation, affording cover for ducks,
pelicans, wild geese, and a score of different kinds of birds which
disport themselves there by the thousand. The Pharaohs, when tired of
residing in cities, here found varied and refreshing scenery, an equable
climate, gardens always gay with flowers, and in the thickets of the
Kerun they could pursue their favourite pastimes of interminable fishing
and of hunting with the boomerang.
</p>
<p>
They desired to repose after death among the scenes in which they had
lived. Their tombs stretch from Heracleo-polis till they nearly meet the
last pyramids of the Memphites: at Dahshur there are still two of them
standing. The northern one is an immense erection of brick, placed in
close proximity to the truncated pyramid, but nearer than it to the edge
of the plateau, so as to overlook the valley. We might be tempted to
believe that the Theban kings, in choosing a site immediately to the
south of the spot where Papi II. slept in his glory, were prompted by
the desire to renew the traditions of the older dynasties prior to
those of the Heracleopolitans, and thus proclaim to all beholders the
antiquity of their lineage. One of their residences was situated at no
great distance, near Miniet Dahshur, the city of Titoui, the favourite
residence of Amenemhâîfc I. It was here that those royal princesses,
Nofirhonît, Sonît-Sonbît, Sîthâthor, and Monît, his sisters, wives, and
daughters, whose tombs lie opposite the northern face of the pyramid,
flourished side by side with Amenemhâît III.

There, as of old in their harem, they slept side by side, and, in spite
of robbers, their mummies have preserved the ornaments with which they
were adorned, on the eve of burial, by the pious act of their lords.
The art of the ancient jewellers, which we have hitherto known only
from pictures on the walls of tombs or on the boards of coffins, is here
exhibited in all its cunning. The ornaments comprise a wealth of
gold gorgets, necklaces of agate beads or of enamelled lotus-flowers,
cornelian, amethyst, and onyx scarabs. Pectorals of pierced gold-work,
inlaid with flakes of vitreous paste or precious stones, bear the
cartouches of Usirtasen III. and of Amenemhâît II., and every one of
these gems of art reveals a perfection of taste and a skilfulness of
handling which are perfectly wonderful.

Their delicacy, and their freshness in spite of their antiquity, make it
hard for us to realize that fifty centuries have elapsed since they
were made. We are tempted to imagine that the royal ladies to whom they
belonged must still be waiting within earshot, ready to reply to our
summons as soon as we deign to call them; we may even anticipate the joy
they will evince when these sumptuous ornaments are restored to them,
and we need to glance at the worm-eaten coffins which contain their
stiff and disfigured mummies to recall our imagination to the stern
reality of fact. Two other pyramids, but in this case of stone, still
exist further south, to the left of the village of Lisht: their casing,
torn off by the fellahîn, has entirely disappeared, and from a distance
they appear to be merely two mounds which break the desert horizon line,
rather than two buildings raised by the hand of man.

The sepulchral chambers, excavated at a great depth in the sand, are now
filled with water which has infiltrated through the soil, and they have
not as yet been sufficiently emptied to permit of an entrance being
effected: one of them contained the body of Usirtasen I.; does
Amenemhâît I. or Amenemhâît II. repose in the other? We know, at all
events, that Usirtasen II. built for himself the pyramid of Illahun,
and Amenemhâît III. that of Hawâra. "Hotpû," the tomb of Usirtasen II.,
stood upon a rocky hill at a distance of some two thousand feet from
the cultivated lands. To the east of it lay a temple, and close to
the temple a town, Haît-Usirtasen-Hotpû&mdash;"the Castle of the Repose of
Usirtasen"&mdash;which was inhabited by the workmen employed in building
the pyramid, who resided there with their families. The remains of the
temple consist of scarcely anything more than the enclosing wall, whose
sides were originally faced with fine white limestone covered with
hieroglyphs and sculptured scenes. It adjoined the wall of the town, and
the neighbouring quarters are almost intact: the streets were straight,
and crossed each other at right angles, while the houses on each side
were so regularly built that a single policeman could keep his eye on
each thoroughfare from one end to the other. The structures were of
rough material hastily put together, and among the <i>débris</i> are to be
found portions of older buildings, stehe, and fragments of statues.
The town began to dwindle after the Pharaoh had taken possession of his
sepulchre; it was abandoned during the XIIIth dynasty, and its ruins
were entombed in the sand which the wind heaped over them. The city
which Amenemhâît III. had connected with his tomb maintained, on the
contrary, a long existence in the course of the centuries. The king's
last resting-place consisted of a large sarcophagus of quartzose
sandstone, while his favourite consort, Nofriuphtah, reposed beside
him in a smaller coffin. The sepulchral chapel was very large, and its
arrangements were of a somewhat complicated character. It consisted of
a considerable number of chambers, some tolerably large, and others
of moderate dimensions, while all of them were difficult of access and
plunged in perpetual darkness: this was the Egyptian Labyrinth, to
which the Greeks, by a misconception, have given a world-wide renown.
Amenemhâît III. or his architects had no intention of building such a
childish structure as that in which classical tradition so fervently
believed. He had richly endowed the attendant priests, and bestowed upon
the cult of his double considerable revenues, and the chambers above
mentioned were so many storehouses for the safekeeping of the treasure
and provisions for the dead, and the arrangement of them was not more
singular than that of ordinary storage depots. As his cult persisted
for a long period, the temple was maintained in good condition during a
considerable time: it had not, perhaps, been abandoned when the Greeks
first visited it.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The identity of the ruins at Hawâra with the remains of
     the Labyrinth, admitted by Jomard-Caristie and by Lepsius,
     disputed by Vassali, has been definitely proved by Pétrie,
     who found remains of the buildings erected by Amenemhâît
     III. under the ruins of a village and some Græco-Roman
     tombs.
</pre>
<p>
The other sovereigns of the XIIth dynasty must have been interred not
far from the tombs of Amenemhâît III. and Usirtasen II.: they also had
their pyramids, of which we may one day discover the site. The outline
of these was almost the same as that of the Memphite pyramids, but the
interior arrangements were different. As at Illahun and Dahshur, the
mass of the work consisted of crude bricks of large size, between which
fine sand was introduced to bind them solidly together, and the whole
was covered with a facing of polished limestone. The passages and
chambers are not arranged on the simple plan which we meet with in
the pyramids of earlier date. Experience had taught the Pharaohs that
neither granite walls nor the multiplication of barriers could preserve
their mummies from profanation: no sooner was vigilance relaxed, either
in the time of civil war or under a feeble administration, than robbers
appeared on the scene, and boring passages through the masonry with
the ingenuity of moles, they at length, after indefatigable patience,
succeeded in reaching the sepulchral vault and despoiling the mummy of
its valuables.

<p>
With a view to further protection, the builders multiplied blind
passages and chambers without apparent exit, but in which a portion of
the ceiling was movable, and gave access to other equally mysterious
rooms and corridors. Shafts sunk in the corners of the chambers and
again carefully closed put the sacrilegious intruder on a false scent,
for, after causing him a great loss of time and labour, they only led
down to the solid rock. At the present day the water of the Nile fills
the central chamber of the Hawâra pyramid and covers the sarcophagus; it
is possible that this was foreseen, and that the builders counted on the
infiltration as an additional obstacle to depredations from without.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Indeed, it should be noted that in the Græco-Roman period
     the presence of water in a certain number of the pyramids
     was a matter of common knowledge, and so frequently was it
     met with, that it was even supposed to exist in a pyramid
     into which water had never penetrated, viz. that of Kheops.
     Herodotus relates that, according to the testimony of the
     interpreters who acted as his guides, the waters of the Nile
     were carried to the sepulchral cavern of the Pharaoh by a
     subterranean channel, and shut it in on all sides, like an
     island.
</pre>
<p>
The hardness of the cement, which fastens the lid of the stone coffin
to the lower part, protects the body from damp, and the Pharaoh, lying
beneath several feet of water, still defies the greed of the robber or
the zeal of the archaeologist.
</p>
<p>
The absolute power of the kings kept their feudal vassals in check: far
from being suppressed, however, the seignorial families continued
not only to exist, but to enjoy continued prosperity. Everywhere, at
Elephantine, Koptos, Thinis, in Aphroditopolis, and in most of the
cities of the Said and of the Delta, there were ruling princes who
were descended from the old feudal lords or even from Pharaohs of the
Memphite period, and who were of equal, if not superior rank, to the
members of the reigning family. The princes of Siut no longer en-joyed
an authority equal to that exercised by their ancestors under the
Heracleopolitan dynasties, but they still possessed considerable
influence. One of them, Hapizaûfi I., excavated for himself, in the
reign of Ûsirtasen I., nor far from the burying-place of Khîti and
Tefabi, that beautiful tomb, which, though partially destroyed by Coptic
monks or Arabs, still attracts visitors and excites their astonishment.

<p>
The lords of Shashotpu in the south, and those of Hermopolis in the
north, had acquired to some extent the ascendency which their neighbours
of Siût had lost. The Hermopolitan princes dated at least from the time
of the VIth dynasty, and they had passed safely through the troublous
times which followed the death of Papi II. A branch of their family
possessed the nome of the Hare, while another governed that of the
Gazelle. The lords of the nome of the Hare espoused the Theban cause,
and were reckoned among the most faithful vassals of the sovereigns of
the south: one of them, Thothotpû, caused a statue of himself, worthy
of a Pharaoh, to be erected in his loyal town of Hermopolis, and their
burying-places at el-Bersheh bear witness to their power no less than
to their taste in art. During the troubles which put an end to the XIth
dynasty, a certain Khnûmhotpû, who was connected in some unknown manner
with the lords of the nome of the Gazelle, entered the Theban service
and accompanied Amenemhâît I. on his campaigns into Nubia. He obtained,
as a reward of faithfulness, Monâît-Khûfûi and the district of
Khûît-Horû,&mdash;"the Horizon of Horus,"&mdash;on the east bank of the Nile. On
becoming possessed of the western bank also, he entrusted the government
of the district which he was giving up to his eldest son, Nakhîti I.;
but, the latter having died without heirs, Usirtasen I. granted to
Biqît, the sister of Nakhîti, the rank and prerogative of a reigning
princess. Biqît married Nûhri, one of the princes of Hermopolis, and
brought with her as her dowry the fiefdom of the Gazelle, thus doubling
the possessions of her husband's house. Khnûmhotpû II., the eldest
of the children born of this union, was, while still young, appointed
Governor of Monâît-Khûfuî, and this title appears to have become an
appanage of his heir-apparent, just as the title of "Prince of Kaûshû"
was, from the XIXth dynasty onwards, the special designation of the heir
to the throne. The marriage of Khnûmhotpû II. with the youthful Khîti,
the heiress of the nome of the Jackal, rendered him master of one of
the most fertile provinces of Middle Egypt. The power of this family was
further augmented under Nakhîti II., son of Khnûmhotpû II. and Khîti:
Nakhîti, prince of the nome of the Jackal in right of his mother, and
lord of that of the Gazelle after the death of his father, received
from Usirtasen II. the administration of fifteen southern nomes, from
Aphroditopolis to Thebes. This is all we know of his history, but it is
probable that his descendants retained the same power and position for
several generations. The career of these dignitaries depended greatly
on the Pharaohs with whom they were contemporary: they accompanied the
royal troops on their campaigns, and with the spoil which they collected
on such occasions they built temples or erected tombs for themselves.
The tombs of the princes of the nome of the Gazelle are disposed along
the right bank of the Nile, and the most ancient are exactly opposite
Minieh. It is at Zawyet el-Meiyetîn and at Kom-el-Ahmar, nearly facing
Hibonu, their capital, that we find the burying-places of those who
lived under the VIth dynasty. The custom of taking the dead across the
Nile had existed for centuries, from the time when the Egyptians first
cut their tombs in the eastern range; it still continues to the present
day, and part of the population of Minieh are now buried, year after
year, in the places which their remote ancestors had chosen as the site
of their "eternal houses." The cemetery lies peacefully in the centre
of the sandy plain at the foot of the hills; a grove of palms, like
a curtain drawn along the river-side, partially conceals it; a Coptic
convent and a few Mahommedan hermits attract around them the tombs of
their respective followers, Christian or Mussulman. The rock-hewn tombs
of the XIIth dynasty succeed each other in one long irregular line
along the cliffs of Beni-Hasan, and the traveller on the Nile sees their
entrances continuously coming into sight and disappearing as he goes
up or descends the river. These tombs are entered by a square aperture,
varying in height and width according to the size of the chapel. Two
only, those of Amoni-Amenemhâît and of Khnûm-hotpû II., have a columned
façade, of which all the members&mdash;pillars, bases, entablatures&mdash;have
been cut in the solid rock: the polygonal shafts of the façade look like
a bad imitation of ancient Doric. Inclined planes or nights of steps,
like those at Elephantine, formerly led from the plain up to the
terrace. Only a few traces of these exist at the present day, and the
visitor has to climb the sandy slope as best he can: wherever he enters,
the walls present to his view inscriptions of immense extent, as well
as civil, sepulchral, military, and historical scenes. These are not
incised like those of the Memphite mastabas, but are painted in fresco
on the stone itself. The technical skill here exhibited is not a whit
behind that of the older periods, and the general conception of the
subjects has not altered since the time of the pyramid-building kings.
The object is always the same, namely, to ensure wealth to the double in
the other world, and to enable him to preserve the same rank among
the departed as he enjoyed among the living: hence sowing, reaping,
cattle-rearing, the exercise of different trades, the preparation and
bringing of offerings, are all represented with the same minuteness as
formerly. But a new element has been added to the ancient themes.

We know, and the experience of the past is continually reiterating the
lesson, that the most careful precautions and the most conscientious
observation of customs were not sufficient to perpetuate the worship of
ancestors. The day was bound to come when not only the descendants of
Khnûmhotpû, but a crowd of curious or indifferent strangers, would visit
his tomb: he desired that they should know his genealogy, his private
and public virtues, his famous deeds, his court titles and dignities,
the extent of his wealth; and in order that no detail should be omitted,
he relates all that he did, or he gives the representation of it upon
the wall. In a long account of two hundred and twenty-two lines, he
gives a <i>résumé</i> of his family history, introducing extracts from his
archives, to show the favours received by his ancestors from the hands
of their sovereigns. Amoni and Khîti, who were, it appears, the warriors
of their race, have everywhere recounted the episodes of their military
career, the movements of their troops, their hand-to-hand fights, and
the fortresses to which they laid siege. These scions of the house
of the Gazelle and of the Hare, who shared with Pharaoh himself the
possession of the soil of Egypt, were no mere princely ciphers: they
had a tenacious spirit, a warlike disposition, an insatiable desire for
enlarging their borders, together with sufficient ability to realize
their aims by court intrigues or advantageous marriage alliances. We can
easily picture from their history what Egyptian feudalism really was,
what were its component elements, what were the resources it had at its
disposal, and we may well be astonished when we consider the power and
tact which the Pharaohs must have displayed in keeping such vassals in
check during two centuries.
</p>
<p>
Amenemhâît I. had abandoned Thebes as a residence in favour of
Heracleopolis and Memphis, and had made it over to some personage who
probably belonged to the royal household. The nome of Ûisît had relapsed
into the condition of a simple fief, and if we are as yet unable to
establish the series of the princes who there succeeded each other
contemporaneously with the Pharaohs, we at least know that all those
whose names have come down to us played an important part in the history
of their times. Montûnsîsû, whose stele was engraved in the XXIVth year
of Amenemhâît I., and who died in the joint reign of this Pharaoh and
his son Usirtasen I., had taken his share in most of the wars conducted
against neighbouring peoples,&mdash;the Anîtiû of Nubia, the Monîtû of Sinai,
and the "Lords of the Sands:" he had dismantled their cities and razed
their fortresses. The principality retained no doubt the same boundaries
which it had acquired under the first Antûfs, but Thebes itself grew
daily larger, and gained in importance in proportion as its frontiers
extended southward. It had become, after the conquests of Usirtasen
III., the very centre of the Egyptian world&mdash;a centre from which the
power of the Pharaoh could equally well extend in a northerly direction
towards the Sinaitic Peninsula and Libya, or towards the Red Sea and
the "humiliated Kûsh" in the south. The influence of its lords increased
accordingly: under Amenemhâît III. and Amenemhâît IV. they were perhaps
the most powerful of the great vassals, and when the crown slipped from
the grasp of the XIIth dynasty, it fell into the hands of one of these
feudatories. It is not known how the transition was brought about which
transferred the sovereignty from the elder to the younger branch of the
family of Amenemhâît I. When Amenemhâît IV. died, his nearest heir was a
woman, his sister Sovkûnofriûrî: she retained the supreme authority
for not quite four years,* and then resigned her position to a certain
Sovkhotpû.**
</p>
<pre>
     * She reigned exactly three years, ten months, and eighteen
     days, according to the fragments of the "Royal Canon of
     Turin" (Lepsius, Auswahl der wichtigten Urkunden, pl. v.
     col. vii. 1. 2).

     ** Sovkhotpû Khûtoûirî, according to the present published
     versions of the Turin Papyrus, an identification which led
     Lieblein (Recherches sur la Chronologie Égyptienne, pp. 102,
     103) and Wiedemann to reject the generally accepted
     assumption that this first king of the XIIIth dynasty was
     Sovkhotpû Sakhemkhûtoûirî. Still, the way in which the
     monuments of Sovkhotpû Sakhemkhûtoûirî and his papyri are
     intermingled with the monuments of Amenemhâît III. at Semneh
     and in the Fayûm, show that it is difficult to separate him
     from this monarch. Moreover, an examination of the original
     Turin Papyrus shows that there is a tear before the word
     Khûtoûirî on the first cartouche, no indication of which
     appears in the facsimile, but which has, none the less,
     slightly damaged the initial solar disk and removed almost
     the whole of one sign. We are, therefore, inclined to
     believe that <i>Sakhemkhûtoûirî</i> was written instead of
     <i>Khûtoûirî</i>, and that, therefore, all the authorities are in
     the right, from their different points of view, and that the
     founder of the XIIIth dynasty was a Sakhemkhûtoûirî I.,
     while the Savkhotpû Sakhemkhûtoûirî, who occupies the
     fifteenth place in the dynasty, was a Sakhemkhûtoûirî II.

</pre>
<p>
Was there a revolution in the palace, or a popular rising, or a civil
war? Did the queen become the wife of the new sovereign, and thus bring
about the change without a struggle? Sovkhotpû was probably lord
of Ûisît, and the dynasty which he founded is given by the native
historians as of Theban origin. His accession entailed no change in the
Egyptian constitution; it merely consolidated the Theban supremacy, and
gave it a recognized position. Thebes became henceforth the head of
the entire country: doubtless the kings did not at once forsake
Heracleopolis and the Fayûm, but they made merely passing visits to
these royal residences at considerable intervals, and after a few
generations even these were given up. Most of these sovereigns resided
and built their Pyramids at Thebes, and the administration of the
kingdom became centralized there. The actual capital of a king was
determined not so much by the locality from whence he ruled, as by the
place where he reposed after death. Thebes was the virtual capital
of Egypt from the moment that its masters fixed on it as their
burying-place.
</p>
<p>
Uncertainty again shrouds the history of the country after Sovkhotpû I.:
not that monuments are lacking or names of kings, but the records of the
many Sovkhotpûs and Nonrhotpûs found in a dozen places in the valley,
furnish as yet no authentic means of ascertaining in what order to
classify them. The XIIIth dynasty contained, so it is said, sixty kings,
who reigned for a period of over 453 years.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This is the number given in one of the lists of Manetho,
     in Muller-Didot, <i>Fragmenta Historicorum Græcorum</i>, vol. ii.
     p. 565. Lepsius's theory, according to which the shepherds
     overran Egypt from the end of the XIIth dynasty and
     tolerated the existence of two vassal dynasties, the XIIIth
     and XIVth, was disputed and refuted by E. de Rougé as soon
     as it appeared; we find the theory again in the works of
     some contemporary Egyptologists, but the majority of those
     who continued to support it have since abandoned their
     position.
</pre>
<p>
The succession did not always take place in the direct line from father
to son: several times, when interrupted by default of male heirs, it
was renewed without any disturbance, thanks to the transmission of royal
rights to their children by princesses, even when their husbands did not
belong to the reigning family. Monthotpû, the father of Sovkhotpu III.,
was an ordinary priest, and his name is constantly quoted by his son;
but solar blood flowed in the veins of his mother, and procured for him
the crown. The father of his successor, Nofirhotpû IL, did not belong
to the reigning branch, or was only distantly connected with it, but his
mother Kamâît was the daughter of Pharaoh, and that was sufficient
to make her son of royal rank. With careful investigation, we should
probably find traces of several revolutions which changed the legitimate
order of succession without, however, entailing a change of dynasty. The
Nofirhotpûs and Sovkhotpûs continued both at home and abroad the work so
ably begun by the Amenemhâîts and the Usirtasens.

They devoted all their efforts to beautifying the principal towns of
Egypt, and caused important works to be carried on in most of them&mdash;at
Karnak, in the great temple of Amon, at Luxor, at Bubastis, at Tanis,
at Tell-Mokhdam, and in the sanctuary of Abydos. At the latter
place, Khâsoshûshrî Nofirhotpû restored to Khontamentit considerable
possessions which the god had lost; Nozirri sent thither one of his
officers to restore the edifice built by Usirtasen I.; Sovkûmsaûf
II. dedicated his own statue in this temple, and private individuals,
following the example set them by their sovereigns, vied with each other
in their gifts of votive stehe. The pyramids of this period were of
moderate size, and those princes who abandoned the custom of building
them were content like Aûtûabrî I. Horû with a modest tomb, close to the
gigantic pyramids of their ancestors. In style the statues of this epoch
show a certain inferiority when compared with the beautiful work of the
XIIth dynasty: the proportions of the human figure are not so good, the
modelling of the limbs is not so vigorous, the rendering of the features
lacks individuality; the sculptors exhibit a tendency, which had been
growing since the time of the Usirtasens, to represent all their sitters
with the same smiling, commonplace type of countenance. There are,
however, among the statues of kings and private individuals which have
come down to us, a few examples of really fine treatment. The colossal
statue of Sovkhotpû IV., which is now in the Louvre side by side with an
ordinary-sized figure of the same Pharaoh, must have had a good effect
when placed at the entrance to the temple at Tanis: his chest is thrown
well forward, his head is erect, and we feel impressed by that noble
dignity which the Memphite sculptors knew how to give to the bearing
and features of the diorite Khephren enthroned at Gîzeh. The sitting
Mirmâshaû of Tanis lacks neither energy nor majesty, and the Sovkûmsaûf
of Abydos, in spite of the roughness of its execution, decidedly holds
its own among the other Pharaohs.
</p>




<p>
The statuettes found in the tombs, and the smaller objects discovered in
the ruins, are neither less carefully nor less successfully treated. The
little scribe at Gîzeh, in the attitude of walking, is a <i>chef d'oeuvre</i>
of delicacy and grace, and might be attributed to one of the best
schools of the XIIth dynasty, did not the inscriptions oblige us to
relegate it to the Theban art of the XIIIth. The heavy and commonplace
figure of the magnate now in the Vienna Museum is treated with a rather
coarse realism, but exhibits nevertheless most skilful tooling. It is
not exclusively at Thebes, or at Tanis, or in any of the other great
cities of Egypt, that we meet with excellent examples of work, or that
we can prove that flourishing schools of sculpture existed at this
period; probably there is scarcely any small town which would not
furnish us at the present day, if careful excavation were carried out,
with some monument or object worthy of being placed in a museum. During
the XIIIth dynasty both art and everything else in Egypt were fairly
prosperous. Nothing attained a very high standard, but, on the other
hand, nothing fell below a certain level of respectable mediocrity.
Wealth exercised, however, an injurious influence upon artistic taste.
The funerary statue, for instance, which Aûtûabrî I. Horû ordered for
himself was of ebony, and seems to have been inlaid originally with
gold, whereas Kheops and Khephren were content to have theirs of
alabaster and diorite.

During this dynasty we hear nothing of the inhabitants of the Sinaitic
Peninsula to the east, or of the Libyans to the west: it was in the
south, in Ethiopia, that the Pharaohs expended all their surplus energy.
The most important of them, Sovkhotpu I., had continued to register the
height of the Nile on the rocks of Semneh, but after his time we
are unable to say where the Nilometer was moved to, nor, indeed, who
displaced it. The middle basin of the river as far as Gebel-Barkal
was soon incorporated with Egypt, and the population became quickly
assimilated. The colonization of the larger islands of Say and Argo
took place first, as their isolation protected them from sudden attacks:
certain princes of the XIIIth dynasty built temples there, and erected
their statues within them, just as they would have done in any of the
most peaceful districts of the Said or the Delta. Argo is still at the
present day one of the largest of these Nubian islands:* it is said to
be 12 miles in length, and about 2 1/2 in width towards the middle.
</p>

It is partly wooded, and vegetation grows there with tropical
luxuriance; creeping plants climb from tree to tree, and form an
almost impenetrable undergrowth, which swarms with game secure from the
sportsman. A score of villages are dotted about in the clearings,
and are surrounded by carefully cultivated fields, in which durra
predominates. An unknown Pharaoh of the XIIIth dynasty built, near to
the principal village, a temple of considerable size; it covered an
area, whose limits may still easily be traced, of 174 feet wide by 292
long from east to west. The main body of the building was of sandstone,
probably brought from the quarries of Tombos: it has been pitilessly
destroyed piecemeal by the inhabitants, and only a few insignificant
fragments, on which some lines of hieroglyphs may still be deciphered,
remain <i>in situ</i>. A small statue of black granite of good workmanship is
still standing in the midst of the ruins. It represents Sovkhotpû III.
sitting, with his hands resting on his knees; the head, which has been
mutilated, lies beside the body.

The same king erected colossal statues of himself at Tanis, Bubastis,
and at Thebes: he was undisputed master of the whole Nile Valley, from
near the spot where the river receives its last tributary to where
it empties itself into the sea. The making of Egypt was finally
accomplished in his time, and if all its component parts were not as yet
equally prosperous, the bond which connected them was strong enough
to resist any attempt to break it, whether by civil discord within or
invasions from without. The country was not free from revolutions, and
if we have no authority for stating that they were the cause of the
downfall of the XIIIth dynasty, the lists of Manetho at least show that
after that event the centre of Egyptian power was again shifted. Thebes
lost its supremacy, and the preponderating influence passed into the
hands of sovereigns who were natives of the Delta. Xoïs, situated in the
midst of the marshes, between the Phatnitic and Sebennytic branches of
the Nile, was one of those very ancient cities which had played but
an insignificant part in shaping the destinies of the country. By what
combination of circumstances its princes succeeded in raising themselves
to the throne of the Pharaohs, we know not: they numbered, so it was
said, seventy-five kings, who reigned four hundred and eighty-four
years, and whose mutilated names darken the pages of the Turin Papyrus.
The majority of them did little more than appear upon the throne, some
reigning three years, others two, others a year or scarcely more than a
few months: far from being a regularly constituted line of sovereigns,
they appear rather to have been a series of Pretenders, mutually jealous
of and deposing one another.
</p>
<p>
The feudal lords who had been so powerful under the Usirtasens had
lost none of their prestige under the Sovkhotpûs: and the rivalries of
usurpers of this kind, who seized the crown without being strong enough
to keep it, may perhaps explain the long sequence of shadowy Pharaohs
with curtailed reigns who constitute the XIVth dynasty. They did not
withdraw from Nubia, of that fact we are certain: but what did they
achieve in the north and north-east of the empire? The nomad tribes were
showing signs of restlessness on the frontier, the peoples of the Tigris
and Euphrates were already pushing the vanguards of their armies into
Central Syria. While Egypt had been bringing the valley of the Nile and
the eastern corner of Africa into subjection, Chaldæa had imposed both
her language and her laws upon the whole of that part of Western Asia
which separated her from Egypt: the time was approaching when these two
great civilized powers of the ancient world would meet each other face
to face and come into fierce collision.
