<i>Syria, owing to its geographical position, condemned to be subject to
neighbouring powers-Lebanon, Anti-Lebanon, the valley of the Orontes
and of the Litâny, and surrounding regions: the northern table-land, the
country about Damascus, the Mediterranean coast, the Jordan and the Dead

    CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
THE FIRST CHALDÆAN EMPIRE AND THE HYKSÔS IN EGYPT
</h2>
<p>
<i>Syria: the part played by it in the ancient world&mdash;Babylon and the
first Chaldæan empire&mdash;The dominion of the Hyksôs: Âhmosis.</i>
</p>
<p>
Some countries seem destined from their origin to become the
battle-fields of the contending nations which environ them. Into such
regions, and to their cost, neighbouring peoples come from century to
century to settle their quarrels and bring to an issue the questions of
supremacy which disturb their little corner of the world. The nations
around are eager for the possession of a country thus situated; it
is seized upon bit by bit, and in the strife dismembered and trodden
underfoot: at best the only course open to its inhabitants is to join
forces with one of its invaders, and while helping the intruder to
overcome the rest, to secure for themselves a position of permanent
servitude. Should some unlooked-for chance relieve them from the
presence of their foreign lord, they will probably be quite incapable of
profiting by the respite which fortune puts in their way, or of making
any effectual attempt to organize themselves in view of future attacks.
They tend to become split up into numerous rival communities, of which
even the pettiest will aim at autonomy, keeping up a perpetual frontier
war for the sake of becoming possessed of or of retaining a glorious
sovereignty over a few acres of corn in the plains, or some wooded
ravines in the mountains. Year after year there will be scenes of bloody
conflict, in which petty armies will fight petty battles on behalf of
petty interests, but so fiercely, and with such furious animosity, that
the country will suffer from the strife as much as, or even more than,
from an invasion. There will be no truce to their struggles until they
all fall under the sway of a foreign master, and, except in the interval
between two conquests, they will have no national existence, their
history being almost entirely merged in that of other nations.
</p>
<p>
From remote antiquity Syria was in the condition just described,
and thus destined to become subject to foreign rule. Chaldæa, Egypt,
Assyria, and Persia presided in turn over its destinies, while Macedonia
and the empires of the West were only waiting their opportunity to lay
hold of it. By its position it formed a kind of meeting-place where most
of the military nations of the ancient world were bound sooner or later
to come violently into collision. Confined between the sea and the
desert, Syria offers the only route of easy access to an army marching
northwards from Africa into Asia, and all conquerors, whether attracted
to Mesopotamia or to Egypt by the accumulated riches on the banks of the
Euphrates or the Nile, were obliged to pass through it in order to reach
the object of their cupidity. It might, perhaps, have escaped this fatal
consequence of its position, had the formation of the country permitted
its tribes to mass themselves together, and oppose a compact body to
the invading hosts; but the range of mountains which forms its backbone
subdivides it into isolated districts, and by thus restricting each
tribe to a narrow existence maintained among them a mutual antagonism.
The twin chains, the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon, which divide the
country down the centre, are composed of the same kind of calcareous
rocks and sandstone, while the same sort of reddish clay has been
deposited on their slopes by the glaciers of the same geological
period.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Drake remarked in the Lebanon several varieties of
     limestone, which have been carefully catalogued by Blanche
     and Lartet. Above these strata, which belong to the Jurassic
     formation, come reddish sandstone, then beds of very hard
     yellowish limestone, and finally marl. The name Lebanon, in
     Assyrian Libnana, would appear to signify "the white
     mountain;" the Amorites called the Anti-Lebanon Saniru,
     Shenir, according to the Assyrian texts and the Hebrew
     books.
</pre>
<p>
Arid and bare on the northern side, they sent out towards the south
featureless monotonous ridges, furrowed here and there by short narrow
valleys, hollowed out in places into basins or funnel-shaped ravines,
which are widened year by year by the down-rush of torrents. These
ridges, as they proceed southwards, become clothed with verdure and
offer a more varied outline, the ravines being more thickly wooded, and
the summits less uniform in contour and colouring. Lebanon becomes white
and ice-crowned in winter, but none of its peaks rises to the altitude
of perpetual snows: the highest of them, Mount Timarun, reaches 10,526
feet, while only three others exceed 9000.* Anti-Lebanon is, speaking
generally, 1000 or 1300 feet lower than its neighbour: it becomes
higher, however, towards the south, where the triple peak of Mount
Hermon rises to a height of 9184 feet. The Orontes and the Litâny drain
the intermediate space. The Orontes rising on the west side of the
Anti-Lebanon, near the ruins of Baalbek, rushes northwards in such a
violent manner, that the dwellers on its banks call it the rebel&mdash;Nahr
el-Asi.** About a third of the way towards its mouth it enters a
depression, which ancient dykes help to transform into a lake; it flows
thence, almost parallel to the sea-coast, as far as the 36th degree of
latitude. There it meets the last spurs of the Amanos, but, failing to
cut its way through them, it turns abruptly to the west, and then to the
south, falling into the Mediterranean after having received an increase
to its volume from the waters of the Afrîn.
</p>
<pre>
     * Bukton-Drake, Unexplored Syria, vol. i. p. 88, attributed
     to it an altitude of 9175 English feet; others estimate it
     at 10,539 feet. The mountains which exceed 3000 metres are
     Dahr el-Kozîb, 3046 metres; Jebel-Mislriyah, 3080 metres;
     and Jebel-Makhmal or Makmal, 3040 metres. As a matter of
     fact, these heights are not yet determined with the accuracy
     desirable.

     ** The Egyptians knew it in early times by the name of
     Aûnrati, or Araûnti; it is mentioned in Assyrian
     inscriptions under the name of Arantû. All are agreed in
     acknowledging that this name is not Semitic, and an Aryan
     origin is attributed to it, but without convincing proof;
     according to Strabo (xvi. ii. § 7, p. 750), it was
     originally called Typhon, and was only styled Orontes after
     a certain Orontes had built the first bridge across it. The
     name of Axios which it sometimes bears appears to have been
     given to it by Greek colonists, in memory of a river in
     Macedonia. This is probably the origin of the modern name of
     Asi, and the meaning, <i>rebellious river</i>, which Arab
     tradition attaches to the latter term, probably comes from a
     popular etymology which likened Axios to Asi, the
     identification was all the easier since it justifies the
     epithet by the violence of its current.
</pre>
<p>
The Litâny rises a short distance from the Orontes; it flows at first
through a wide and fertile plain, which soon contracts, however, and
forces it into a channel between the spurs of the Lebanon and the
Galilæan hills. The water thence makes its way between two cliffs of
perpendicular rock, the ravine being in several places so narrow that
the branches of the trees on the opposite sides interlace, and an active
man could readily leap across it. Near Yakhmur some detached rocks
appear to have been arrested in their fall, and, leaning like flying
buttresses against the mountain face, constitute a natural bridge over
the torrent. The basins of the two rivers lie in one valley, extending
eighty leagues in length, divided by an almost imperceptible watershed
into two beds of unequal slope. The central part of the valley is given
up to marshes. It is only towards the south that we find cornfields,
vineyards, plantations of mulberry and olive trees, spread out over the
plain, or disposed in terraces on the hillsides. Towards the north,
the alluvial deposits of, the Orontes have gradually formed a black
and fertile soil, upon which grow luxuriant crops of cereals and other
produce. Cole-Syria, after having generously nourished the Oriental
empires which had preyed upon her, became one of the granaries of the
Roman world, under the capable rule of the Cæsars.
</p>
<p>
Syria is surrounded on all sides by countries of varying aspect and
soil. That to the north, flanked by the Amanos, is a gloomy mountainous
region, with its greatest elevation on the seaboard: it slopes gradually
towards the interior, spreading out into chalky table-lands, dotted over
with bare and rounded hills, and seamed with tortuous valleys which
open out to the Euphrates, the Orontes, or the desert. Vast, slightly
undulating plains succeed the table-lands: the soil is dry and stony,
the streams are few in number and contain but little water. The Sajur
flows into the Euphrates, the Afrîn and the Karasu when united yield
their tribute to the Orontes, while the others for the most part pour
their waters into enclosed basins. The Khalus of the Greeks sluggishly
pursues its course southward, and after reluctantly leaving the gardens
of Aleppo, finally loses itself on the borders of the desert in a small
salt lake full of islets: about halfway between the Khalus and the
Euphrates a second salt lake receives the Nahr ed-Dahab, the "golden
river." The climate is mild, and the temperature tolerably uniform. The
sea-breeze which rises every afternoon tempers the summer heat: the
cold in winter is never piercing, except when the south wind blows which
comes from the mountains, and the snow rarely lies on the ground for
more than twenty-four hours. It seldom rains during the autumn and
winter months, but frequent showers fall in the early days of spring.
Vegetation then awakes again, and the soil lends itself to cultivation
in the hollows of the valleys and on the table-lands wherever
irrigation is possible. The ancients dotted these now all but desert
spaces with wells and cisterns; they intersected them with canals,
and covered them with farms and villages, with fortresses and populous
cities. Primæval forests clothed the slopes of the Amanos, and pinewood
from this region was famous both at Babylon and in the towns of Lower
Chaldæa. The plains produced barley and wheat in enormous quantities,
the vine throve there, the gardens teemed with flowers and fruit, and
pistachio and olive trees grew on every slope. The desert was always
threatening to invade the plain, and gained rapidly upon it whenever
a prolonged war disturbed cultivation, or when the negligence of the
inhabitants slackened the work of defence: beyond the lakes and salt
marshes it had obtained a secure hold. At the present time the greater
part of the country between the Orontes and the Euphrates is nothing
but a rocky table-land, ridged with low hills and dotted over with some
impoverished oases, excepting at the foot of Anti-Lebanon, where two
rivers, fed by innumerable streams, have served to create a garden of
marvellous beauty. The Barada, dashing from cascade to cascade, flows
for some distance through gorges before emerging on the plain: scarcely
has it reached level ground than it widens out, divides, and forms
around Damascus a miniature delta, into which a thousand interlacing
channels carry refreshment and fertility. Below the town these streams
rejoin the river, which, after having flowed merrily along for a day's
journey, is swallowed up in a kind of elongated chasm from whence it
never again emerges. At the melting of the snows a regular lake is
formed here, whose blue waters are surrounded by wide grassy margins
"like a sapphire set in emeralds." This lake dries up almost completely
in summer, and is converted into swampy meadows, filled with gigantic
rushes, among which the birds build their nests, and multiply as
unmolested as in the marshes of Chaldæa. The Awaj, unfed by any
tributary, fills a second deeper though smaller basin, while to
the south two other lesser depressions receive the waters of the
Anti-Lebanon and the Hauran. Syria is protected from the encroachments
of the desert by a continuous barrier of pools and beds of reeds:
towards the east the space reclaimed resembles a verdant promontory
thrust boldly out into an ocean of sand. The extent of the cultivated
area is limited on the west by the narrow strip of rock and clay which
forms the littoral. From the mouth of the Litâny to that of the Orontes,
the coast presents a rugged, precipitous, and inhospitable appearance.
There are no ports, and merely a few ill-protected harbours, or narrow
beaches lying under formidable headlands. One river, the Nahr el-Kebir,
which elsewhere would not attract the traveller's attention, is here
noticeable as being the only stream whose waters flow constantly and
with tolerable regularity; the others, the Leon, the Adonis,* and the
Nahr el-Kelb,* can scarcely even be called torrents, being precipitated
as it were in one leap from the Lebanon to the Mediterranean. Olives,
vines, and corn cover the maritime plain, while in ancient times the
heights were clothed with impenetrable forests of oak, pine, larch,
cypress, spruce, and cedar. The mountain range drops in altitude towards
the centre of the country and becomes merely a line of low hills,
connecting Gebel Ansarieh with the Lebanon proper; beyond the latter
it continues without interruption, till at length, above the narrow
Phoenician coast road, it rises in the form of an almost insurmountable
wall. Near to the termination of Coele-Syria, but separated from it
by a range of hills, there opens out on the western slopes of Hermon a
valley unlike any other in the world. At this point the surface of the
earth has been rent in prehistoric times by volcanic action, leaving a
chasm which has never since closed up. A river, unique in character&mdash;the
Jordan&mdash;flows down this gigantic crevasse, fertilizing the valley formed
by it from end to end.***

     * The Adonis of classical authors is now Nahr-Ibrahim. We
     have as yet no direct evidence as to the Phoenician name of
     this river; it was probably identical with that of the
     divinity worshipped on its banks. The fact of a river
     bearing the name of a god is not surprising: the Belos, in
     the neighbourhood of Acre, affords us a parallel case to the
     Adonis.

     ** The present Nahr el-Kelb is the Lykos of classical
     authors. The Due de Luynes thought he recognized a
     corruption of the Phoenician name in that of Alcobile, which
     is mentioned hereabouts in the Itinerary of the pilgrim of
     Bordeaux. The order of the Itinerary does not favour this
     identification, and Alcobile is probably Jebail: it is none
     the less probable that the original name of the Nahr el Kelb
     contained from earliest times the Phoenician equivalent of
     the Arab word <i>kelb</i>, "dog."

The water collects in an oval rocky basin hidden by bushes, and flows
down among the brushwood to join the Nahr el-Hasbany, which brings the
waters of the upper torrents to swell its stream; a little lower down it
mingles with the Banias branch, and winds for some time amidst desolate
marshy meadows before disappearing in the thick beds of rushes bordering
Lake Huleh.*

     surrounding country, shows that the modern word Huleh is
     derived from an ancient form, of which unfortunately the
     original has not come down to us.

At this point the Jordan reaches the level of the Mediterranean, but
instead of maintaining it, the river makes a sudden drop on leaving the

some 300 feet before reaching the Lake of Grenesareth, where it is only
momentarily arrested, as if to gather fresh strength for its headlong
career southwards.

Here and there it makes furious assaults on its right and left banks,

Nothing could offer more striking contrasts than the country on either
bank. On the east, the ground rises abruptly to a height of about 3000
feet, resembling a natural rampart flanked with towers and bastions:
behind this extends an immense table-land, slightly undulating and
intersected in all directions by the affluents of the Jordan and the
Dead Sea&mdash;the Yarmuk,* the Jabbok,** and the Arnon.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The Yarmuk does not occur in the Bible, but we meet with
     its name in the Talmud, and the Greeks adopted it under the
     form Hieromax.

     ** <i>Gen.</i> xxxii. 22; Numb, xxi. 24. The name has been

     Môjib. [Shephelah = "low country," plain (Josh. xi. 16).
     With the article it means the plain along the Mediterranean
     from Joppa to Gaza.&mdash;Te.]
</pre>
<p>
The whole of this district forms a little world in itself, whose
inhabitants, half shepherds, half bandits, live a life of isolation,
with no ambition to take part in general history. West of the Jordan, a
confused mass of hills rises into sight, their sparsely covered slopes
affording an impoverished soil for the cultivation of corn, vines, and
olives. One ridge&mdash;Mount Carmel&mdash;detached from the principal chain
near the southern end of the Lake of Genesareth, runs obliquely to
the north-west, and finally projects into the sea. North of this range
extends Galilee, abounding in refreshing streams and fertile fields;
while to the south, the country falls naturally into three parallel
zones&mdash;the littoral, composed alternately of dunes and marshes&mdash;an
expanse of plain, a "Shephelah," dotted about with woods and watered by
intermittent rivers,&mdash;and finally the mountains. The region of dunes
is not necessarily barren, and the towns situated in it&mdash;Gaza, Jaffa,
Ashdod, and Ascalon&mdash;are surrounded by flourishing orchards and gardens.
The plain yields plentiful harvests every year, the ground needing no
manure and very little labour. The higher ground and the hill-tops are
sometimes covered with verdure, but as they advance southwards, they
become denuded and burnt by the sun. The valleys, too, are watered only
by springs, which are dried up for the most part during the summer, and
the soil, parched by the continuous heat, can scarcely be distinguished
from the desert. In fact, till the Sinaitic Peninsula and the frontiers
of Egypt are reached, the eye merely encounters desolate and almost
uninhabited solitudes, devastated by winter torrents, and overshadowed
by the volcanic summits of Mount Seir. The spring rains, however,
cause an early crop of vegetation to spring up, which for a few weeks
furnishes the flocks of the nomad tribes with food.
</p>
<p>
We may summarise the physical characteristics of Syria by saying that
Nature has divided the country into five or six regions of unequal
area, isolated by rivers and mountains, each one of which, however, is
admirably suited to become the seat of a separate independent state.
In the north, we have the country of the two rivers&mdash;the
Naharaim&mdash;extending from the Orontes to the Euphrates and the Balikh, or
even as far as the Khabur:* in the centre, between the two ranges of
the Lebanon, lie Coele-Syria and its two unequal neighbours, Aram of
Damascus and Phoenicia; while to the south is the varied collection of
provinces bordering the valley of the Jordan.
</p>
<pre>
     * The Naharaim of the Egyptians was first identified with
     Mesopotamia; it was located between the Orontes and the
     Balikh or the Euphrates by Maspero. This opinion is now
     adopted by the majority of Egyptologists, with slight
     differences in detail. Ed. Meyer has accurately compared the
     Egyptian Naharaim with the Parapotamia of the administration
     of the Seleucidæ.
</pre>
<p>
It is impossible at the present day to assert, with any approach to
accuracy, what peoples inhabited these different regions towards the
fourth millennium before our era. Wherever excavations are made, relics
are brought to light of a very ancient semi-civilization, in which we
find stone weapons and implements, besides pottery, often elegant in
contour, but for the most part coarse in texture and execution. These
remains, however, are not accompanied by any monument of definite
characteristics, and they yield no information with regard to the
origin or affinities of the tribes who fashioned them.* The study of the
geographical nomenclature in use about the XVIth century B.C. reveals
the existence, at all events at that period, of several peoples and
several languages. The mountains, rivers, towns, and fortresses in
Palestine and Coele-Syria are designated by words of Semitic origin: it
is easy to detect, even in the hieroglyphic disguise which they bear
on the Egyptian geographical lists, names familiar to us in Hebrew or
Assyrian.
</p>
<pre>
     * Researches with regard to the primitive inhabitants of
     Syria and their remains have not as yet been prosecuted to
     any extent. The caves noticed by Hedenborg at Ant-Elias,
     near Tripoli, and by Botta at Nahr el-Kelb, and at Adlun by
     the Duc de Luynes, have been successively explored by
     Lartet, Tristram, Lortet, and Dawson. The grottoes of
     Palestine proper, at Bethzur, at Gilgal near Jericho, and at
     Tibneh, have been the subject of keen controversy ever since
     their discovery. The Abbé Richard desired to identify the
     flints of Gilgal and Tibneh with the stone knives used by
     Joshua for the circumcision of the Israelites after the
     passage of the Jordan (<i>Josh.</i> v- 2-9), some of which might
     have been buried in that hero's tomb.
</pre>
<p>
But once across the Orontes, other forms present themselves which reveal
no affinities to these languages, but are apparently connected with one
or other of the dialects of Asia Minor.* The tenacity with which the
place-names, once given, cling to the soil, leads us to believe that a
certain number at least of those we know in Syria were in use there long
before they were noted down by the Egyptians, and that they must have
been heirlooms from very early peoples. As they take a Semitic or
non-Semitic form according to their geographical position, we may
conclude that the centre and south were colonized by Semites, and the
north by the immigrant tribes from beyond the Taurus. Facts are not
wanting to support this conclusion, and they prove that it is not so
entirely arbitrary as we might be inclined to believe. The Asiatic
visitors who, under a king of the XIIth dynasty, came to offer gifts to
Khnûmhotpû, the Lord of Beni-Hasan, are completely Semitic in type,
and closely resemble the Bedouins of the present day. Their
chief&mdash;Abisha&mdash;bears a Semitic name,** as too does the Sheikh Ammianshi,
with whom Sinûhit took refuge.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The non-Semitic origin of the names of a number of towns
     in Northern Syria preserved in the Egyptian lists, is
     admitted by the majority of scholars who have studied the
     question.

     ** His name has been shown to be cognate with the Hebrew
     Abishai (1 Sam. xxvi. 6-9; 2 Sam. ii. 18, 24; xxi. 17) and
     with the Chaldæo-Assyrian Abeshukh.

     *** The name Ammianshi at once recalls those of Ammisatana,
     Ammiza-dugga, and perhaps Ammurabi, or Khammurabi, of one of
     the Babylonian dynasties; it contains, with the element
     Ammi, a final <i>anshi</i>. Chabas connects it with two Hebrew
     words <i>Am-nesh</i>, which he does not translate.
</pre>
<p>
Ammianshi himself reigned over the province of Kadimâ, a word which in
Semitic denotes the East. Finally, the only one of their gods known to
us, Hadad, was a Semite deity, who presided over the atmosphere, and
whom we find later on ruling over the destinies of Damascus. Peoples
of Semitic speech and religion must, indeed, have already occupied the
greater part of that region on the shores of the Mediterranean which we
find still in their possession many centuries later, at the time of the
Egyptian conquest.

For a time Egypt preferred not to meddle in their affairs. When,
however, the "lords of the sands" grew too insolent, the Pharaoh sent a
column of light troops against them, and inflicted on them such a severe
punishment, that the remembrance of it kept them within bounds for
years. Offenders banished from Egypt sought refuge with the turbulent
kinglets, who were in a perpetual state of unrest between Sinai and
the Dead Sea. Egyptian sailors used to set out to traffic along the
seaboard, taking to piracy when hard pressed; Egyptian merchants were
accustomed to penetrate by easy stages into the interior. The accounts
they gave of their journeys were not reassuring. The traveller had first
to face the solitudes which confronted him before reaching the Isthmus,
and then to avoid as best he might the attacks of the pillaging tribes
who inhabited it.

Should he escape these initial perils, the Amu&mdash;an agricultural and
settled people inhabiting the fertile region&mdash;would give the stranger
but a sorry reception: he would have to submit to their demands, and
the most exorbitant levies of toll did not always preserve caravans from
their attacks.* The country seems to have been but thinly populated;
tracts now denuded were then covered by large forests in which herds of
elephants still roamed,** and wild beasts, including lions and leopards,
rendered the route through them dangerous.
</p>
<pre>
     * The merchant who sets out for foreign lands "leaves his
     possessions to his children&mdash;for fear of lions and

     of Niî.
</pre>
<p>
The notion that Syria was a sort of preserve for both big and small
game was so strongly implanted in the minds of the Egyptians, that their
popular literature was full of it: the hero of their romances betook
himself there for the chase, as a prelude to meeting with the princess
whom he was destined to marry,* or, as in the case of Kazarâti, chief
of Assur, that he might encounter there a monstrous hyena with which to
engage in combat.
</p>
<pre>
     * As, for instance, the hero in the <i>Story of the
     Predestined Prince</i>, exiled from Egypt with his dog, pursues
     his way hunting till he reaches the confines of Naharaim,
     where he is to marry the prince's daughter.
</pre>
<p>
These merchants' adventures and explorations, as they were not followed
by any military expedition, left absolutely no mark on the industries or
manners of the primitive natives: those of them only who were close to
the frontiers of Egypt came under her subtle charm and felt the power
of her attraction, but this slight influence never penetrated beyond
the provinces lying nearest to the Dead Sea. The remaining populations
looked rather to Chaldæa, and received, though at a distance, the
continuous impress of the kingdoms of the Euphrates. The tradition which
attributes to Sargon of Agadê, and to his son Istaramsin, the subjection
of the people of the Amanos and the Orontes, probably contains but a
slight element of truth; but if, while awaiting further information, we
hesitate to believe that the armies of these princes ever crossed the
Lebanon or landed in Cyprus, we must yet admit the very early advent
of their civilization in those western countries which are regarded as
having been under their rule. More than three thousand years before
our era, the Asiatics who figure on the tomb of Khnûmhotpû clothed
themselves according to the fashions of Uru and Lagash, and affected
long robes of striped and spotted stuffs. We may well ask if they had
also borrowed the cuneiform syllabary for the purposes of their official
correspondence,* and if the professional scribe with his stylus and clay
tablet was to be found in their cities. The Babylonian courtiers were,
no doubt, more familiar visitors among them than the Memphite nobles,
while the Babylonian kings sent regularly to Syria for statuary stone,
precious metals, and the timber required in the building of
their monuments: Urbau and Gudea, as well as their successors and
contemporaries, received large convoys of materials from the Amanos, and
if the forests of Lebanon were more rarely utilised, it was not because
their existence was unknown, but because distance rendered their
approach more difficult and transport more costly. The Mediterranean
marches were, in their language, classed as a whole under one
denomination&mdash;Martu, Amurru,** the West&mdash;but there were distinctive
names for each of the provinces into which they were divided.
</p>
<pre>
     * The most ancient cuneiform tablets of Syrian origin are
     not older than the XVIth century before our era; they
     contain the official, correspondence of the native princes
     with the Pharaohs Amenôthes III. and IV. of the XVIIIth
     dynasty, as will be seen later on in this volume; they were
     discovered in the ruins of one of the palaces at Tel el-
     Amarna in Egypt.

     ** Formerly read Akharru. Martu would be the Sumerian and
     Akharru the Semitic form, Akharru meaning <i>that which is
     behind</i>. The discovery of the Tel el-Amarna tablets threw
     doubt on the reading of the name Akharru: some thought that
     it ought to be kept in any case; others, with more or less
     certainty, think that it should be replaced by Amuru,
     Amurru, the country of the Amorites. But the question has
     now been settled by Babylonian contract and law tablets of
     the period of Khaminurabi, in which the name is written <i>A-
     mu-ur-ri (ki)</i>. Hommel originated the idea that Martu might
     be an abbreviation of Amartu, that is, Amar with the
     feminine termination of nouns in the Canaanitish dialect:
     Martu would thus actually signify <i>the country of the
     Amorites</i>.
</pre>
<p>
Probably even at that date they called the north Khati,* and Cole-Syria,
Amurru, the land of the Amorites. The scattered references in their
writings seem to indicate frequent intercourse with these countries, and
that, too, as a matter of course which excited no surprise among their
contemporaries: a journey from Lagash to the mountains of Tidanum and
to Gubin, or to the Lebanon and beyond it to Byblos,** meant to them
no voyage of discovery. Armies undoubtedly followed the routes already
frequented by caravans and flotillas of trading boats, and the time came
when kings desired to rule as sovereigns over nations with whom their
subjects had peaceably traded.
</p>
<pre>
     * The name of the Khati, Khatti, is found in the <i>Book of
     Omens</i>, which is supposed to contain an extract from the
     annals of Sargon and Naramsin; as, however, the text which
     we possess of it is merely a copy of the time of
     Assurbanipal, it is possible that the word Khati is merely
     the translation of a more ancient term, perhaps Martu.
     Winckler thinks it to be included in Lesser Armenia and the
     Melitônê of classical authors.

     ** Gubin is probably the Kûpûna, Kûpnû, of the Egyptians,
     the Byblos of Phoenicia. Amiaud had proposed a most unlikely
     identification with Koptos in Egypt. In the time of Inê-Sin,
     King of Ur, mention is found of Simurru, Zimyra.
</pre>
<p>
It does not appear, however, that the ancient rulers of Lagash ever
extended their dominion so far. The governors of the northern cities, on
the other hand, showed themselves more energetic, and inaugurated
that march westwards which sooner or later brought the peoples of the
Euphrates into collision with the dwellers on the Nile: for the first
Babylonian empire without doubt comprised part if not the whole of
Syria.*
</p>
<pre>
     * It is only since the discovery of the Tel el-Amarna
     tablets that the fact of the dominant influence of Chaldæa
     over Syria and of its conquest has been definitely realized.
     It is now clear that the state of things of which the
     tablets discovered in Egypt give us a picture, could only be
     explained by the hypothesis of a Babylonish supremacy of
     long duration over the peoples situated between the
     Euphrates and the Mediterranean.
</pre>
<p>
Among the most celebrated names in ancient history, that of Babylon is
perhaps the only one which still suggests to our minds a sense of vague
magnificence and undefined dominion. Cities in other parts of the world,
it is true, have rivalled Babylon in magnificence and power: Egypt could
boast of more than one such city, and their ruins to this day present to
our gaze more monuments worthy of admiration than Babylon ever contained
in the days of her greatest prosperity. The pyramids of Memphis and the
colossal statues of Thebes still stand erect, while the ziggurâts and
the palaces of Chaldæa are but mounds of clay crumbling into the plain;
but the Egyptian monuments are visible and tangible objects; we can
calculate to within a few inches the area they cover and the elevation
of their summits, and the very precision with which we can gauge their
enormous size tends to limit and lessen their effect upon us. How is it
possible to give free rein to the imagination when the subject of it is
strictly limited by exact and determined measurements? At Babylon, on
the contrary, there is nothing remaining to check the flight of fancy: a
single hillock, scoured by the rains of centuries, marks the spot where
the temple of Bel stood erect in its splendour; another represents the
hanging gardens, while the ridges running to the right and left were
once the ramparts.

of man and to his long sojourn on the spot. But these vestiges are so
mutilated and disfigured that the principal outlines of the buildings
cannot be determined with any certainty, and afford us no data for
guessing their dimensions. He who would attempt to restore the ancient
appearance of the place would find at his disposal nothing but vague
indications, from which he might draw almost any conclusion he pleased.

Palaces and temples would take a shape in his imagination on a plan
which never entered the architect's mind; the sacred towers as they rose
would be disposed in more numerous stages than they actually possessed;
the enclosing walls would reach such an elevation that they must have
quickly fallen under their own weight if they had ever been carried
so high: the whole restoration, accomplished without any certain data,
embodies the concept of something vast and superhuman, well befitting
the city of blood and tears, cursed by the Hebrew prophets. Babylon was,
however, at the outset, but a poor town, situated on both banks of the
Euphrates, in a low-lying, flat district, intersected by canals and
liable at times to become marshy. The river at this point runs almost
directly north and south, between two banks of black mud, the base of
which it is perpetually undermining. As long as the city existed, the
vertical thrust of the public buildings and houses kept the river within
bounds, and even since it was finally abandoned, the masses of <i>debris</i>
have almost everywhere had the effect of resisting its encroachment;
towards the north, however, the line of its ancient quays has given
way and sunk beneath the waters, while the stream, turning its course
westwards, has transferred to the eastern bank the gardens and mounds
originally on the opposite side. E-sagilla, the temple of the lofty
summit, the sanctuary of Merodach, probably occupied the vacant space in
the depression between the Babil and the hill of the Kasr.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The temple of Merodach, called by the Greeks the temple of
     Belos, has been placed on the site called Babîl by the two
     Rawlinsons; and by Oppert; Hormuzd Rassam and Fr. Delitzsch
     locate it between the hill of Junjuma and the Kasr, and
     considers Babîl to be a palace of Nebuchadrezzar.
</pre>
<p>
In early times it must have presented much the same appearance as
the sanctuaries of Central Chaldæa: a mound of crude brick formed the
substructure of the dwellings of the priests and the household of the
god, of the shops for the offerings and for provisions, of the treasury,
and of the apartments for purification or for sacrifice, while the whole
was surmounted by a ziggurât. On other neighbouring platforms rose the
royal palace and the temples of lesser divinities,* elevated above the
crowd of private habitations.

     hill of Amrân-ibn-Ali, the temple of Shamash, and others,

     with the second Chaldæan empire.

The houses of the people were closely built around these stately piles,
on either side of narrow lanes. A massive wall surrounded the whole,
shutting out the view on all sides; it even ran along the bank of the
Euphrates, for fear of a surprise from that quarter, and excluded the
inhabitants from the sight of their own river. On the right bank rose
a suburb, which was promptly fortified and enlarged, so as to become a
second Babylon, almost equalling the first in extent and population.

Beyond this, on the outskirts, extended gardens and fields, finding at
length their limit at the territorial boundaries of two other towns,
Kutha and Borsippa, whose black outlines are visible to the east and
south-west respectively, standing isolated above the plain. Sippara on
the north, Nippur on the south, and the mysterious Agadê, completed the
circle of sovereign states which so closely hemmed in the city of Bel.
We may surmise with all probability that the history of Babylon in early
times resembled in the main that of the Egyptian Thebes. It was a small
seigneury in the hands of petty princes ceaselessly at war with petty
neighbours: bloody struggles, with alternating successes and reverses,
were carried on for centuries with no decisive results, until the day
came when some more energetic or fortunate dynasty at length crushed its
rivals, and united under one rule first all the kingdoms of Northern and
finally those of Southern Chaldæa.
</p>
<p>
The lords of Babylon had, ordinarily, a twofold function, religious
and military, the priest at first taking precedence of the soldier, but
gradually yielding to the latter as the town increased in power.
They were merely the priestly representatives or administrators of
Babel&mdash;<i>shakannaku Babili</i>&mdash;and their authority was not considered
legitimate until officially confirmed by the god. Each ruler was obliged
to go in state to the temple of Bel Merodach within a year of his
accession: there he had to take the hands of the divine statue, just
as a vassal would do homage to his liege, and those only of the native
sovereigns or the foreign conquerors could legally call themselves Kings
of Babylon&mdash;<i>sharru Babili</i>&mdash;who had not only performed this rite, but
renewed it annually.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The meaning of the ceremony in which the kings of Babylon
     "took the hands of Bel" has been given by Winckler; Tiele
     compares it very aptly with the rite performed by the
     Egyptian kings&mdash;at Heliopolis, for example, when they
     entered alone the sanctuary of Râ, and there contemplated
     the god face to face. The rite was probably repeated
     annually, at the time of the Zakmuku, that is, the New Year
     festival.
</pre>
<p>
Sargon the Elder had lived in Babylon, and had built himself a palace
there: hence the tradition of later times attributed to this city the
glory of having been the capital of the great empire founded by the
Akkadian dynasties. The actual sway of Babylon, though arrested to the
south by the petty states of Lower Chaldæa, had not encountered to the
north or north-west any enemy to menace seriously its progress in that
semi-fabulous period of its history. The vast plain extending between
the Euphrates and the Tigris is as it were a continuation of the
Arabian desert, and is composed of a grey, or in parts a whitish, soil
impregnated with selenite and common salt, and irregularly superimposed
upon a bed of gypsum, from which asphalt oozes up here and there,
forming slimy pits. Frost is of rare occurrence in winter, and rain is
infrequent at any season; the sun soon burns up the scanty herbage
which the spring showers have encouraged, but fleshy plants successfully
resist its heat, such as the common salsola, the salsola soda, the
pallasia, a small mimosa, and a species of very fragrant wormwood,
forming together a vari-coloured vegetation which gives shelter to
the ostrich and the wild ass, and affords the flocks of the nomads a
grateful pasturage when the autumn has set in. The Euphrates bounds
these solitudes, but without watering them. The river flows, as far as
the eye can see, between two ranges of rock or bare hills, at the foot
of which a narrow strip of alluvial soil supports rows of date-palms
intermingled here and there with poplars, sumachs, and willows. Wherever
there is a break in the two cliffs, or where they recede from the river,
a series of shadufs takes possession of the bank, and every inch of the
soil is brought under cultivation. The aspect of the country remains
unchanged as far as the embouchure of the Khabur; but there a black
alluvial soil replaces the saliferous clay, and if only the water were
to remain on the land in sufficient quantity, the country would be
unrivalled in the world for the abundance and variety of its crops.

The fields, which are regularly sown in the neighbourhood of the small
towns, yield magnificent harvests of wheat and barley: while in the
prairie-land beyond the cultivated ground the grass grows so high that
it comes up to the horses' girths. In some places the meadows are so
covered with varieties of flowers, growing in dense masses, that the
effect produced is that of a variegated carpet; dogs sent in among them
in search of game, emerge covered with red, blue, and yellow pollen.
This fragrant prairie-land is the delight of bees, which produce
excellent and abundant honey, while the vine and olive find there a
congenial soil. The population was unequally distributed in this region.
Some half-savage tribes were accustomed to wander over the plain,
dwelling in tents, and supporting life by the chase and by the rearing
of cattle; but the bulk of the inhabitants were concentrated around the
affluents of the Euphrates and Tigris, or at the foot of the northern
mountains wherever springs could be found, as in Assur, Singar, Nisibis,
Tilli,* Kharranu, and in all the small fortified towns and nameless
townlets whose ruins are scattered over the tract of country between the
Khabur and the Balikh. Kharranu, or Harran, stood, like an advance guard
of Chaldæan civilization, near the frontiers of Syria and Asia Minor.**
To the north it commanded the passes which opened on to the basins of
the Upper Euphrates and Tigris; it protected the roads leading to the
east and south-east in the direction of the table-land of Iran and the
Persian Gulf, and it was the key to the route by which the commerce of
Babylon reached the countries lying around the Mediterranean. We have no
means of knowing what affinities as regards origin or race connected
it with Uru, but the same moon-god presided over the destinies of both
towns, and the Sin of Harran enjoyed in very early times a renown nearly
equal to that of his namesake.
</p>
<pre>
     * Tilli, the only one of these towns mentioned with any
     certainty in the inscriptions of the first Chaldæan empire,
     is the Tela of classical authors, and probably the present
     Werânshaher, near the sources of the Balikh.

     ** Kharranu was identified by the earlier Assyriologists
     with the Harran of the Hebrews (<i>Gen.</i> v. 12), the Carrhse
     of classical authors, and this identification is still
     generally accepted.
</pre>
<p>
He was worshipped under the symbol of a conical stone, probably an
aerolite, surmounted by a gilded crescent, and the ground-plan of the
town roughly described a crescent-shaped curve in honour of its patron.
His cult, even down to late times, was connected with cruel practices;
generations after the advent to power of the Abbasside caliphs, his
faithful worshippers continued to sacrifice to him human victims, whose
heads, prepared according to the ancient rite, were accustomed to give
oracular responses.* The government of the surrounding country was
in the hands of princes who were merely vicegerents:** Chaldæan
civilization before the beginnings of history had more or less laid hold
of them, and made them willing subjects to the kings of Babylon.***
</p>
<pre>
     * Without seeking to specify exactly which were the
     doctrines introduced into Harranian religion subsequently to
     the Christian era, we may yet affirm that the base of this
     system of faith was merely a very distorted form of the
     ancient Chaldæan worship practised in the town.

     ** Only one vicegerent of Mesopotamia is known at present,
     and he belongs to the Assyrian epoch. His seal is preserved
     in the British Museum.

     *** The importance of Harran in the development of the
     history of the first Chaldæan empire was pointed out by
     Winckler; but the theory according to which this town was
     the capital of the kingdom, called by the Chaldæan and
     Assyrian scribes "the kingdom of the world," is justly
     combated by Tiele.
</pre>
<p>
These sovereigns were probably at the outset somewhat obscure
personages, without much prestige, being sometimes independent and
sometimes subject to the rulers of neighbouring states, among others to
those of Agadê. In later times, when Babylon had attained to universal
power, and it was desired to furnish her kings with a continuous
history, the names of these earlier rulers were sought out, and added
to those of such foreign princes as had from time to time enjoyed the
sovereignty over them&mdash;thus forming an interminable list which for
materials and authenticity would well compare with that of the Thinite
Pharaohs. This list has come down to us incomplete, and its remains do
not permit of our determining the exact order of reigns, or the status
of the individuals who composed it. We find in it, in the period
immediately subsequent to the Deluge, mention of mythical heroes,
followed by names which are still semi-legendary, such as Sargon the
Elder; the princes of the series were, however, for the most part
real beings, whose memories had been preserved by tradition, or whose
monuments were still existing in certain localities. Towards the end of
the XXVth century before our era, however, a dynasty rose into power of
which all the members come within the range of history.*
</p>
<pre>
     * This dynasty, which is known to us in its entirety by the
     two lists of G. Smith and by Pinches, was legitimately
     composed of only eleven kings, and was known as the
     Babylonian dynasty, although Sayce suspects it to be of
     Arabian origin. It is composed as follows:&mdash;
</pre>
<a name="image-0016"><!--IMG--></a>
<center>
<img src="images/039.jpg" height="257" width="683"
alt="039.jpg Table 
">
</center>

<p>
The dates of this dynasty are not fixed with entire certainty. The first
of them, Sumuabîm, has left us some contracts bearing the dates of one
or other of the fifteen years of his reign, and documents of public or
private interest abound in proportion as we follow down the line of his
successors. Sumulaîlu, who reigned after him, was only distantly related
to his predecessor; but from Sumulaîlu to Sam-shusatana the kingly power
was transmitted from father to son without a break for nine generations,
if we may credit the testimony of the official lists.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Simulaîlu, also written Samu-la-ilu, whom Mr. Pinches has
     found in a contract tablet associated with Pungunila as
     king, was not the son of Sumuabîm, since the lists do not
     mention him as such; he must, however, have been connected
     with some sort of relationship, or by marriage, with his
     predecessor, since both are placed in the same dynasty. A
     few contracts of Sumulaîlu are given by Meissner. Samsuiluna
     calls him "my forefather (d-gula-mu), the fifth king before
     me."

     Hommel believes that the order of the dynasties has been
     reversed, and that the first upon the lists we possess was
     historically the second; he thus places the Babylonian
     dynasty between 2035 and 1731 B.C. His opinion has not been
     generally adopted, but every Assyriologist dealing with this
     period proposes a different date for the reigns in this
     dynasty; to take only one characteristic example, Khammurabi
     is placed by Oppert in the year 2394-2339, by Delitzsch-
     Murdter in 2287-2232, by Winckler in 2264-2210, and by
     Peiser in 2139-2084, and by Carl Niebuhr in 2081-2026.
</pre>
<p>
Contemporary records, however, prove that the course of affairs did
not always run so smoothly. They betray the existence of at least
one usurper&mdash;Immêru&mdash;who, even if he did not assume the royal titles,
enjoyed the supreme power for several years between the reigns of Zabu
and Abilsin. The lives of these rulers closely resembled those of their
contemporaries of Southern Chaldæa. They dredged the ancient canals, or
constructed new ones; they restored the walls of their fortresses, or
built fresh strongholds on the frontier;* they religiously kept the
festivals of the divinities belonging to their terrestrial domain, to
whom they annually rendered solemn homage.
</p>
<pre>
     * Sumulaîlu had built six such large strongholds of brick,
     which were repaired by Samsuiluna five generations later. A
     contract of Sinmuballit is dated the year in which he built
     the great wall of a strong place, the name of which is
     unfortunately illegible on the fragment which we possess.
</pre>
<p>
They repaired the temples as a matter of course, and enriched them
according to their means; we even know that Zabu, the third in order
of the line of sovereigns, occupied himself in building the sanctuary
Eulbar of Anunit, in Sippara. There is evidence that they possessed the
small neighbouring kingdoms of Kishu, Sippara, and Kuta, and that they
had consolidated them into a single state, of which Babylon was the
capital. To the south their possessions touched upon those of the kings
of Uru, but the frontier was constantly shifting, so that at one time an
important city such as Nippur belonged to them, while at another it fell
under the dominion of the southern provinces. Perpetual war was waged
in the narrow borderland which separated the two rival states, resulting
apparently in the balance of power being kept tolerably equal between
them under the immediate successors of Sumuabîm* &mdash;the obscure Sumulaîlu,
Zabum, the usurper Immeru, Abîlsin and Sinmuballit&mdash;until the reign of
Khammurabi (the son of Sinmuballit), who finally made it incline to
his side.** The struggle in which he was engaged, and which, after many
vicissitudes, he brought to a successful issue, was the more decisive,
since he had to contend against a skilful and energetic adversary who
had considerable forces at his disposal. Birnsin*** was, in reality, of
Elamite race, and as he held the province of Yamutbal in appanage, he
was enabled to muster, in addition to his Chaldæan battalions, the army
of foreigners who had conquered the maritime regions at the mouth of the
Tigris and the Euphrates.
</p>
<pre>
     * None of these facts are as yet historically proved: we
     may, however, conjecture with some probability what was the
     general state of things, when we remember that the first
     kings of Babylon were contemporaries of the last independent
     sovereigns of Southern Chaldæa.

     ** The name of this prince has been read in several ways&mdash;
     Hammurabi, Khammurabi, by the earlier Assyriologists,
     subsequently Hammuragash, Khammuragash, as being of Elamite
     or Cossoan extraction: the reading Khammurabi is at present
     the prevailing one. The bilingual list published by Pinches
     makes Khammurabi an equivalent of the Semitic names Kimta-
     rapashtum. Hence Halévy concluded that Khammurabi was a
     series of ideograms, and that Kimtarapashtum was the true
     reading of the name; his proposal, partially admitted by
     Hommel, furnishes us with a mixed reading of Khammurapaltu,
     Amraphel. [Hommel is now convinced of the identity of the
     Amraphel of <i>Gen.</i> xiv. I with Khammurabi.&mdash;Te.] Sayce,
     moreover, adopts the reading Khammurabi, and assigns to him
     an Arabian origin. The part played by this prince was
     pointed out at an early date by Menant. Recent discoveries
     have shown the important share which he had in developing
     the Chaldæan empire, and have, increased his reputation with
     Assyriologists.

     *** The name of this king has been the theme of heated
     discussions: it was at first pronounced Aradsin, Ardusin, or
     Zikarsin; it is now read in several different ways&mdash;Rimsin,
     or Eriaku, Riaku, Rimagu. Others have made a distinction
     between the two forms, and have made out of them the names
     of two different kings. They are all variants of the same
     name. I have adopted the form Rimsin, which is preferred by
     a few Assyriologists. [The tablets recently discovered by
     Mr. Pinches, referring to Kudur-lagamar and Tudkhula, which
     he has published in a Paper road before the Victoria
     Institute, Jan. 20, 1896, have shown that the true reading
     is Eri-Aku. The Elamite name Eri-Aku, "servant of the moon-
     god," was changed by some of his subjects into the
     Babylonian Rim-Sin, "Have mercy, O Moon-god!" just as
     Abêsukh, the Hebrew Absihu'a ("the father of welfare") was
     transformed into the Babylonian Ebisum ("the actor").&mdash;Ed.]

It was not the first time that Elam had audaciously interfered in
the affairs of her neighbours. In fabulous times, one of her mythical
kings&mdash;Khumbaba the Ferocious&mdash;had oppressed. Uruk, and Gilgames with
all his valour was barely able to deliver the town. Sargon the Elder is
credited with having subdued Elam; the kings and vicegerents of Lagash,
as well as those of Uru and. Larsam, had measured forces with Anshan,
but with no decisive issue. From time to time they obtained an
advantage, and we find recorded in the annals victories gained by Gudea,
Inê-sin, or Bursin, but to be followed only by fresh reverses; at the
close of such campaigns, and in order to seal the ensuing peace, à
princess of Susa would be sent as a bride to one of the Chaldæan cities,
or a Chaldæan lady of royal birth would enter the harem of a king of
Anshân. Elam was protected along the course of the Tigris and on the
shores of the Nâr-Marratum by a wide marshy region, impassable except
at a few fixed and easily defended places. The alluvial plain extending
behind the marshes was as rich and fertile as that of Chaldæa. Wheat and
barley ordinarily yielded an hundred and at times two hundredfold; the
towns were surrounded by a shadeless belt of palms; the almond, fig,
acacia, poplar, and willow extended in narrow belts along the rivers'
edge. The climate closely resembles that of Chaldaja: if the midday heat
in summer is more pitiless, it is at least tempered by more frequent
east winds. The ground, however, soon begins to rise, ascending
gradually towards the north-east. The distant and uniform line of
mountain-peaks grows loftier on the approach of the traveller, and the
hills begin to appear one behind another, clothed halfway up with thick
forests, but bare on their summits, or scantily covered with meagre
vegetation. They comprise, in fact, six or seven parallel ranges,
resembling natural ramparts piled up between the country of the Tigris
and the table-land of Iran. The intervening valleys were formerly lakes,
having had for the most part no communication with each other and no
outlet into the sea. In the course of centuries they had dried up,
leaving a thick deposit of mud in the hollows of their ancient beds,
from which sprang luxurious and abundant harvests. The rivers&mdash;the
Uknu,* the Ididi,** and the Ulaî***&mdash;which water this region are, on
reaching more level ground, connected by canals, and are constantly
shifting their beds in the light soil of the Susian plain: they soon
attain a width equal to that of the Euphrates, but after a short time
lose half their volume in swamps, and empty themselves at the present
day into the Shatt-el-Arab. They flowed formerly into that part of the
Persian Gulf which extended as far as Kornah, and the sea thus formed
the southern frontier of the kingdom.
</p>
<pre>
     * The Uknu is the Kerkhah of the present day, the Choaspes
     of the Greeks.

     ** The Ididi was at first identified with the ancient
     Pasitigris, which scholars then desired to distinguish from
     the Eulseos: it is now known to be the arm of the Karun
     which runs to Dizful, the Koprates of classical times, which
     has sometimes been confounded with the Eulaws.

     *** The Ulaî, mentioned in the Hebrew texts (Ban. viii. 2,
     16), the Euloos of classical writers, also called
     Pasitigris. It is the Karun of the present day, until its
     confluence with the Shaûr, and subsequently the Shaûr
     itself, which waters the foot of the Susian hills.
</pre>
<p>
From earliest times this country was inhabited by three distinct
peoples, whose descendants may still be distinguished at the present
day, and although they have dwindled in numbers and become mixed with
elements of more recent origin, the resemblance to their forefathers
is still very remarkable. There were, in the first place, the short
and robust people of well-knit figure, with brown skins, black hair and
eyes, who belonged to that negritic race which inhabited a considerable
part of Asia in prehistoric times.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The connection of the negroid type of Susians with the
     negritic races of India and Oceania, has been proved, in the
     course of M. Dieulafoy's expedition to the Susian plains and
     the ancient provinces of Elam.

<p>
These prevailed in the lowlands and the valleys, where the warm, damp
climate favoured their development; but they also spread into the
mountain region, and had pushed their outposts as far as the first
slopes of the Iranian table-land. They there contact with white-skinned
of medium height, who were probably allied to the nations of Northern
and Central Asia&mdash;to the Scythians,* for instance, if it is permissible
to use a vague term employed by the Ancients.
</p>
<pre>
     * This last-mentioned people is, by some authors, for
     reasons which, so far, can hardly be considered conclusive,
     connected with the so-called Sumerian race, which we find
     settled in Chaldæa. They are said to have been the first to
     employ horses and chariots in warfare.

Semites of the same stock as those of Chaldæa pushed forward as far as
the east bank of the Tigris, and settling mainly among the marshes led a
precarious life by fishing and pillaging.* The country of the plain
was called Anzân, or Anshân,** and the mountain region Numma, or Ilamma,
"the high lands:" these two names were subsequently used to denote the
whole country, and Ilamma has survived in the Hebrew word Elam.*** Susa,
the most important and flourishing town in the kingdom, was situated
between the Ulaî and the Ididi, some twenty-five or thirty miles from
the nearest of the mountain ranges.
</p>
<pre>
     * From the earliest times we meet beyond the Tigris with
     names like that of Durilu, a fact which proves the existence
     of races speaking a Semitic dialect in the countries under
     the suzerainty of the King of Elam: in the last days of the
     Chaldæan empire they had assumed such importance that the
     Hebrews made out Elam to be one of the sons of Shem (<i>Gen.</i>
     x. 22).

     ** Anzân, Anshân, and, by assimilation of the nasal with the
     sibilant, Ashshân. This name has already been mentioned in
     the inscriptions of the kings and vicegerents of Lagash and
     in the <i>Book of Prophecies</i> of the ancient Chaldæan
     astronomers; it also occurs in the royal preamble of Cyrus
     and his ancestors, who like him were styled "kings of
     Anshân." It had been applied to the whole country of Elam,
     and afterwards to Persia. Some are of opinion that it was
     the name of a part of Elam, viz. that inhabited by the
     Turanian Medes who spoke the second language of the
     Achæmenian inscriptions, the eastern half, bounded by the
     Tigris and the Persian Gulf, consisting of a flat and swampy
     land. These differences of opinion gave rise to a heated
     controversy; it is now, however, pretty generally admitted
     that Anzân-Anshân was really the plain of Elam, from the
     mountains to the sea, and one set of authorities affirms
     that the word Anzân may have meant "plain" in the language
     of the country, while others hesitate as yet to pronounce
     definitely on this point.

     *** The meaning of "Nunima," "Ilamma," "Ilamtu," in the
     group of words used to indicate Elam, had been recognised
     even by the earliest Assyriologists; the name originally
     referred to the hilly country on the north and east of Susa.
     To the Hebrews, Elam was one of the sons of Shem (Gen. x.
     22). The Greek form of the name is Elymais, and some of the
     classical geographers were well enough acquainted with the
     meaning of the word to be able to distinguish the region to
     which it referred from Susiana proper.

Its fortress and palace were raised upon the slopes of a mound which
overlooked the surrounding country:* at its base, to the eastward,
stretched the town, with its houses of sun-dried bricks.**

     * Susa, in the language of the country, was called Shushun;
     this name was transliterated into Chaldæo-Assyrian, by
     Shushan, Shushi.

     ** Strabo tells us, on the authority of Polycletus, that the
     town had no walls in the time of Alexander, and extended
     over a space two hundred stadia in length; in the
     VIII century B.C. it was enclosed by walls with bastions,
     which are shown on a bas-relief of Assurbanipal, but it was
     surrounded by unfortified suburbs.

Further up the course of the Uknu, lay the following cities: Madaktu,
the Badaca of classical authors,* rivalling Susa in strength and
importance; Naditu,** Til-Khumba,*** Dur-Undash,**** Khaidalu.^&mdash;all
large walled towns, most of which assumed the title of royal cities.
Elam in reality constituted a kind of feudal empire, composed of several
tribes&mdash;the Habardip, the Khushshi, the Umliyash, the people of Yamutbal
and of Yatbur^^&mdash;all independent of each other, but often united under
the authority of one sovereign, who as a rule chose Susa as the seat of
government.
</p>
<pre>
     * Madaktu, Mataktu, the Badaka of Diodorus, situated on the
     Eulaaos, between Susa and Ecbatana, has been placed by
     Rawlinson near the bifurcation of the Kerkhah, either at
     Paipul or near Aiwân-i-Kherkah, where there are some rather
     important and ancient ruins; Billerbeck prefers to put it at
     the mouth of the valley of Zal-fer, on the site at present
     occupied by the citadel of Kala-i-Riza.

     ** Naditu is identified by Finzi with the village of
     Natanzah, near Ispahan; it ought rather to be looked for in
     the neighbourhood of Sarna.

     *** Til-Khumba, the Mound of Khumba, so named after one of
     the principal Elamite gods, was, perhaps, situated among the
     ruins of Budbar, towards the confluence of the Ab-i-Kirind
     and Kerkhah, or possibly higher up in the mountain, in the
     vicinity of Asmanabad.

     **** Dur-Undash, Dur-Undasi, has been identified, without
     absolutely conclusive reason, with the fortress of Kala-i-
     Dis on the Disful-Rud.

     ^ Khaidalu, Khidalu, is perhaps the present fortress of Dis-
     Malkan.

     ^^ The countries of Yatbur and Yamutbal extended into the
     plain between the marshes of the Tigris and the mountain;
     the town of Durilu was near the Yamutbal region, if not in
     that country itself. Umliyash lay between the Uknu and the
     Tigris.

The language is not represented by any idioms now spoken, and its
affinities with the Sumerian which some writers have attempted to
establish, are too uncertain to make it safe to base any theory upon
them.*

<pre>
     * A great part of the Susian inscriptions have been
     collected by Fr. Lenormant. An attempt has been made to
     identify the language in which they are written with the
     Sumero-accadian, and authorities now generally agree in
     considering the Arcæmenian inscriptions of the second type
     as representative of its modern form. Hommel connects it
     with Georgian, and includes it in a great linguistic family,
     which comprises, besides these two idioms, the Hittite, the
     Cappadocian, the Armenian of the Van inscriptions, and the
     Cosstean. Oppert claims to have discovered on a tablet in
     the British Museum a list of words belonging to one of the
     idioms (probably Semitic) of Susiana, which differs alike
     from the Suso-Medic and the Assyrian.

<p>
The little that we know of Elamite religion reveals to us a mysterious
world, full of strange names and vague forms. Over their hierarchy
there presided a deity who was called Shushinak (the Susian), Dimesh or
Samesh, Dagbag, As-siga, Adaene, and possibly Khumba and Æmmân, whom
the Chaldæns identified with their god Ninip; his statue was concealed
in a sanctuary inaccessible to the profane, but it was dragged from
thence by Assurbanipal of Nineveh in the VIIth century B.C.* This deity
was associated with six others of the first rank, who were divided into
two triads&mdash;Shumudu, Lagamaru, Partikira; Ammankasibar, Uduran, and
Sapak: of these names, the least repellent, Ammankasibar, may possibly
be the Memnon of the Greeks. The dwelling of these divinities was near
Susa, in the depths of a sacred forest to which the priests and kings
alone had access: their images were brought out on certain days to
receive solemn homage, and were afterwards carried back to their shrine
accompanied by a devout and reverent multitude. These deities received
a tenth of the spoil after any successful campaign&mdash;the offerings
comprising statues of the enemies' gods, valuable vases, ingots of
gold and silver, furniture, and stuffs. The Elamite armies were well
organized, and under a skilful general became irresistible. In other
respects the Elamites closely resembled the Chaldæans, pursuing the same
industries and having the same agricultural and commercial instincts. In
the absence of any bas-reliefs and inscriptions peculiar to this people,
we may glean from the monuments of Lagash and Babylon a fair idea of the
extent of their civilization in its earliest stages.
</p>
<pre>
     * <i>Shushinak</i> is an adjective derived from the name of the
     town of Susa. The real name of the god was probably kept
     secret and rarely uttered. The names which appear by the
     side of Shushinak in the text published by H. Rawlinson, as
     equivalents of the Babylonian Ninip, perhaps represent
     different deities; we may well ask whether the deity may not
     be the Khumba, Umma, Ummân, who recurs so frequently in the
     names of men and places, and who has hitherto never been met
     with alone in any formula or dedicatory tablet.
</pre>

The cities of the Euphrates, therefore, could have been sensible of but
little change, when the chances of war transferred them from the rule of
their native princes to that of an Elamite. The struggle once over, and
the resulting evils repaired as far as practicable, the people of these
towns resumed their usual ways, hardly conscious of the presence of
their foreign ruler. The victors, for their part, became assimilated so
rapidly with the vanquished, that at the close of a generation or so
the conquering dynasty was regarded legitimate and national one, loyally
attached to the traditions and religion of its adopted country. In the
year 2285 B.C., towards the close of the reign of Nurrammân, or in
the earlier part of that of Siniddinam, a King of Elam, by name
Kudur-nakhunta, triumphantly marched through Chaldæa from end to end,
devastating the country and sparing neither town nor temple: Uruk lost
its statue of Nana, which was carried off as a trophy and placed in the
sanctuary of Susa. The inhabitants long mourned the detention of their
goddess, and a hymn of lamentation, probably composed for the occasion
by one of their priests, kept the remembrance of the disaster fresh in
their memories. "Until when, oh lady, shall the impious enemy ravage the
country!&mdash;In thy queen-city, Uruk, the destruction is accomplished,&mdash;in
Eulbar, the temple of thy oracle, blood has flowed like water,&mdash;upon the
whole of thy lands has he poured out flame, and it is spread abroad like
smoke.&mdash;Oh, lady, verily it is hard for me to bend under the yoke of
misfortune!&mdash;? Oh, lady, thou hast wrapped me about, thou hast plunged
me, in sorrow!&mdash;The impious mighty one has broken me in pieces like a
reèd,&mdash;and I know not what to resolve, I trust not in myself,&mdash;like a
bed of reeds I sigh day and night!&mdash;I, thy servant, I bow myself before
thee!" It would appear that the whole of Chaldæa, including Babylon
itself, was forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the invader;* a
Susian empire thus absorbed Chaldæa, reducing its states to feudal
provinces, and its princes to humble vassals. Kudur-nakhunta having
departed, the people of Larsa exerted themselves to the utmost to repair
the harm that he had done, and they succeeded but too well, since their
very prosperity was the cause only a short time after of the outburst
of another storm. Siniddinam, perhaps, desired to shake off the Elamite
yoke. Simtishilkhak, one of the successors of Kudur-nakhunta, had
conceded the principality of Yamutbal as a fief to Kudur-mabug, one
of his sons. Kudur-mabug appears to have been a conqueror of no mean
ability, for he claims, in his inscriptions, the possession of the whole
of Syria.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The submission of Babylon is evident from the title Adda
     Martu, "sovereign of the West," assumed by several of the
     Elamite princes (of. p. 65 of the present work): in order to
     extend his authority beyond the Euphrates, it was necessary
     for the King of Elam to be first of all master of Babylon.
     In the early days of Assyriology it was supposed that this
     period of Elamite supremacy coincided with the Median
     dynasty of Berosus.

     ** His preamble contains the titles <i>adda Martu,</i> "prince of
     Syria;" <i>adda lamutbal</i>, "prince of Yamutbal." The word
     <i>adda</i> seems properly to mean "lather," and the literal
     translation of the full title would probably be "father of
     Syria," "<i>father</i> of Yamutbal," whence the secondary
     meanings "master, lord, prince," which have been
     provisionally accepted by most Assyriologists. Tiele, and
     Winckler after him, have suggested that Martu is here
     equivalent to Yamutbal, and that it was merely used to
     indicate the western part of Elam; Winckler afterwards
     rejected this hypothesis, and has come round to the general
     opinion.
</pre>
<p>
He obtained a victory over Siniddinam, and having dethroned him, placed
the administration of the kingdom in the hands of his own son Eimsin.
This prince, who was at first a feudatory, afterwards associated in the
government with his father, and finally sole monarch after the
latter's death, married a princess of Chaldæan blood, and by this means
legitimatized his usurpation in the eyes of his subjects. His domain,
which lay on both sides of the Tigris and of the Euphrates, comprised,
besides the principality of Yamutbal, all the towns dependent on Sumer
and Accad&mdash;Uru, Larsa, Uruk, and Nippur, He acquitted himself as a good
sovereign in the sight of gods and men: he repaired the brickwork in the
temple of Nannar at Uru; he embellished the temple of Shamash at Larsa,
and caused two statues of copper to be cast in honour of the god; he
also rebuilt Lagash and Grirsu. The city of Uruk had been left a heap of
ruins after the withdrawal of Kudur-nakhunta: he set about the work of
restoration, constructed a sanctuary to Papsukal, raised the ziggurât of
Nana, and consecrated to the goddess an entire set of temple furniture
to replace that carried off by the Elamites. He won the adhesion of the
priests by piously augmenting their revenues, and throughout his reign
displayed remarkable energy. Documents exist which attribute to him the
reduction of Durilu, on the borders of Elam and the Chaldæan states;
others contain discreet allusions to a perverse enemy who disturbed
his peace in the north, and whom he successfully repulsed. He drove
Sinmuballit out of Ishin, and this victory so forcibly impressed
his contemporaries, that they made it the starting-point of a new
semi-official era; twenty-eight years after the event, private contracts
still continued to be dated by reference to the taking of Ishin.
Sinmuballit's son, Khammurabi, was more fortunate. Eimsin vainly
appealed for help against him to his relative and suzerain
Kudur-lagamar, who had succeeded Simtishilkhak at Susa. Eimsin was
defeated, and disappeared from the scene of action, leaving no trace
behind him, though we may infer that he took refuge in his fief of
Yamutbal. The conquest by Khammurabi was by no means achieved at one
blow, the enemy offering an obstinate resistance. He was forced to
destroy several fortresses, the inhabitants of which had either risen
against him or had refused to do him homage, among them being those
of Meîr* and Malgu. When the last revolt had been put down, all the
countries speaking the language of Chaldæa and sharing its civilization
were finally united into a single kingdom, of which Khammurabi
proclaimed himself the head. Other princes who had preceded him had
enjoyed the same opportunities, but their efforts had never been
successful in establishing an empire of any duration; the various
elements had been bound together for a moment, merely to be dispersed
again after a short interval. The work of Khammurabi, on the contrary,
was placed on a solid foundation, and remained unimpaired under his
successors. Not only did he hold sway without a rival in the south as
in the north, but the titles indicating the rights he had acquired over
Sumer and Accad were inserted in his Protocol after those denoting his
hereditary possessions,&mdash;the city of Bel and the four houses of the
world. Khammurabi's victory marks the close of those long centuries of
gradual evolution during which the peoples of the Lower Euphrates passed
from division to unity. Before his reign there had been as many states
as cities, and as many dynasties as there were states; after him there
was but one kingdom under one line of kings.
</p>
<pre>
     * Maîru, Meîr, has been identified with Shurippak; but it
     is, rather, the town of Mar, now Tell-Id. A and Lagamal, the
     Elamite Lagamar, were worshipped there. It was the seat of a
     linen manufacture, and possessed large shipping.
</pre>
<p>
Khammurabi's long reign of fifty-five years has hitherto yielded us but
a small number of monuments&mdash;seals, heads of sceptres, alabaster vases,
and pompous inscriptions, scarcely any of them being of historical
interest. He was famous for the number of his campaigns, no details of
which, however, have come to light, but the dedication of one of his
statues celebrates his good fortune on the battlefield. "Bel has lent
thee sovereign majesty: thou, what awaitest thou?&mdash;Sin has lent thee
royalty: thou, what awaitest thou?&mdash;Ninip has lent thee his supreme
weapon: thou, what awaitest thou?&mdash;The goddess of light, Ishtar,
has lent thee the shock of arms and the fray: thou, what awaitest
thou?&mdash;Shamash and Bamman are thy varlets: thou, what awaitest thou?&mdash;It
is Khammurabi, the king, the powerful chieftain&mdash;who cuts the enemies
in pieces,&mdash;the whirlwind of battle&mdash;who overthrows the country of the
rebels&mdash;who stays combats, who crushes rebellions,&mdash;who destroys
the stubborn like images of clay,&mdash;who overcomes the obstacles of
inaccessible mountains." The majority of these expeditions were, no
doubt, consequent on the victory which destroyed the power of Kimsin.
It would not have sufficed merely to drive back the Elamites beyond the
Tigris; it was necessary to strike a blow within their own territory to
avoid a recurrence of hostilities, which might have endangered the still
recent work of conquest. Here, again, Khammurabi seems to have met with
his habitual success.

Ashnunak was a border district, and shared the fate of all the provinces
on the eastern bank of the Tigris, being held sometimes by Elam and
sometimes by Chaldæa; properly speaking, it was a country of Semitic
speech, and was governed by viceroys owning allegiance, now to Babylon,
now to Susa.* Khammurabi seized this province, and permanently secured
its frontier by building along the river a line of fortresses surrounded
by earthworks. Following the example of his predecessors, he set himself
to restore and enrich the temples.
</p>
<pre>
     * Pognon discovered inscriptions of four of the vicegerents
     of Ashnunak, which he assigns, with some hesitation, to the
     time of Khammurabi, rather than to that of the kings of
     Telloh. Three of these names are Semitic, the fourth
     Sumerian; the language of the inscriptions bears a
     resemblance to the Semitic dialect of Chaldæa.

<p>
The house of Zamama and Ninni, at Kish, was out of repair, and the
ziggurât threatened to fall; he pulled it down and rebuilt it, carrying
it to such a height that its summit "reached the heavens." Merodach had
delegated to him the government of the faithful, and had raised him to
the rank of supreme ruler over the whole of Chaldæa. At Babylon, close
to the great lake which served as a reservoir for the overflow of the
Euphrates, the king restored the sanctuary of Esagilla, the dimensions
of which did not appear to him to be proportionate to the growing
importance of the city. "He completed this divine dwelling with great
joy and delight, he raised the summit to the firmament," and then
enthroned Merodach and his spouse, Zarpanit, within it, amid great
festivities. He provided for the ever-recurring requirements of the
national religion by frequent gifts; the tradition has come down to us
of the granary for wheat which he built at Babylon, the sight of which
alone rejoiced the heart of the god. While surrounding Sippar with a
great wall and a fosse, to protect its earthly inhabitants, he did
not forget Shamash and Malkatu, the celestial patrons of the town. He
enlarged in their honour the mysterious Ebarra, the sacred seat of their
worship, and that which no king from the earliest times had known how
to build for his divine master, that did he generously for Shamash
his master. He restored Ezida, the eternal dwelling of Merodach,
at Borsippa; Eturka-lamma, the temple of Anu, Ninni, and Nana, the
suzerains of Kish; and also Ezikalamma, the house of the goddess Ninna,
in the village of Zarilab. In the southern provinces, but recently added
to the crown,&mdash;at Larsa, Uruk, and Uru,&mdash;he displayed similar activity.

He had, doubtless, a political as well as a religious motive in all he
did; for if he succeeded in winning the allegiance of the priests by
the prodigality of his pious gifts, he could count on their gratitude in
securing for him the people's obedience, and thus prevent the outbreak
of a revolt. He had, indeed, before him a difficult task in attempting
to allay the ills which had been growing during centuries of civil
discord and foreign conquest. The irrigation of the country demanded
constant attention, and from earliest times its sovereigns had directed
the work with real solicitude; but owing to the breaking up of the
country into small states, their respective resources could not be
combined in such general operations as were needed for controlling the
inundations and effectually remedying the excess or the scarcity of
water. Khammurabi witnessed the damage done to the whole province of
Umliyash by one of those terrible floods which still sometimes ravage
the regions of the Lower Tigris,* and possibly it may have been to
prevent the recurrence of such a disaster that he undertook the work of
canalization.
</p>
<pre>
     * Contracts dated the year of an inundation which laid waste
     Umliyash; cf. in our own time, the inundation of April 10,
     1831, which in a single night destroyed half the city of
     Bagdad, and in which fifteen thousand persons lost their
     lives either by drowning or by the collapse of their houses.
</pre>
<p>
He was the first that we know of who attempted to organize and reduce
to a single system the complicated network of ditches and channels which
intersected the territory belonging to the great cities between Babylon
and the sea. Already, more than half a century previously, Siniddinam
had enlarged the canal on which Larsa was situated, while Bimsin had
provided an outlet for the "River of the Gods" into the Persian Gulf:*
by the junction of the two a navigable channel was formed between the
Euphrates and the marshes, and an outlet was thus made for the surplus
waters of the inundation. Khammurabi informs us how Anu and Bel, having
confided to him the government of Sumer and Accad, and having placed in
his hands the reins of power, he dug the Nâr-Khammurabi, the source of
wealth to the people, which brings abundance of water to the country
of Sumir and Accad. "I turned both its banks into cultivated ground, I
heaped up mounds of grain and I furnished perpetual water for the people
of Sumir and Accad. The country of Sumer and Accad, I gathered together
its nations who were scattered, I gave them pasture and drink, I ruled
over them in riches and abundance, I caused them to inhabit a peaceful
dwelling-place. Then it was that Khammurabi, the powerful king, the
favourite of the great gods, I myself, according to the prodigious
strength with which Merodach had endued me, I constructed a high
fortress, upon mounds of earth; its summit rises to the height of the
mountains, at the head of the Nâr-Khammurabi, the source of wealth to
the people. This fortress I called Dur-Sinmuballit-abim-uâlidiya, the
Fortress of Sinmuballit, the father who begat me, so that the name of
Sinmuballit, the father who begat me, may endure in the habitations of
the world."
</p>
<pre>
     * Contract dated "the year the Tigris, river of the gods,
     was canalized down to the sea"; i.e. as far as the point to
     which the sea then penetrated in the environs of Kornah.
</pre>
<p>
This canal of Khammurabi ran from a little south of Babylon, joining
those of Siniddinam and Rimsin, and probably cutting the alluvial plain
in its entire length.* It drained the stagnant marshes on either side
along its course, and by its fertilising effects, the dwellers on its
banks were enabled to reap full harvests from the lands which previously
had been useless for purposes of cultivation. A ditch of minor
importance pierced the isthmus which separates the Tigris and the
Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Sippar.** Khammurabi did not rest
contented with these; a system of secondary canals doubtless completed
the whole scheme of irrigation which he had planned after the
achievement of his conquest, and his successors had merely to keep up
his work in order to ensure an unrivalled prosperity to the empire.
</p>
<pre>
     * Delattre is of opinion that the canal dug by Khammurabi is
     the Arakhtu of later epochs which began at Babylon and
     extended as far as the Larsa canal. It must therefore be
     approximately identified with the Shatt-en-Nil of the
     present day, which joins Shatt-el-Kaher, the canal of
     Siniddinam.

     ** The canal which Khammurabi caused to be dug or dredged
     may be the Nâr-Malkâ, or "royal canal," which ran from the
     Tigris to the Euphrates, passing Sippar on the way. The
     digging of this canal is mentioned in a contract.
</pre>
<p>
Their efforts in this direction were not unsuccessful. Samsuîluna,
the son of Khammurabi, added to the existing system two or three
fresh canals, one at least of which still bore his name nearly fifteen
centuries later; it is mentioned in the documents of the second Assyrian
empire in the time of Assurbanipal, and it is possible that traces of
it may still be found at the present day. Abiêshukh,* Ammisatana,**
Ammizadugga,*** and Samsusatana,**** all either continued to elaborate
the network planned by their ancestors, or applied themselves to the
better distribution of the overflow in those districts where cultivation
was still open to improvement.
</p>
<pre>
     * Abîshukh (the Hebrew Abishua) is the form of the name
     which we find in contemporary contracts. The official lists
     contain the variant Ebishu, Ebîshum.

     ** Ammiditana is only a possible reading: others prefer
     Ammisatana. The Nâr-Ammisatana is mentioned in a Sippar
     contract. Another contract is dated "the year in which
     Ammisatana, the king, repaired the canal of Samsuîluna."

     *** This was, at first, read Ammididugga. Ammizadugga is
     mentioned in the date of a contract as having executed
     certain works&mdash;of what nature it is not easy to say&mdash;on the
     banks of the Tigris; another contract is dated "the year in
     which Ammizadugga, the king, by supreme command of Sha-mash,
     his master, [dug] the Ndr-Ammizadugga-nulchus-nishi (canal
     of Ammizadugga), prosperity of men." In the Minæan
     inscriptions of Southern Arabia the name is found under the
     form of Ammi-Zaduq.

     **** Sometimes erroneously read Samdiusatana; but, as a
     matter of fact, we have contracts of that time, in which a
     royal name is plainly written as Samsusatana.
</pre>
<p>
We should know nothing of these kings had not the scribes of those times
been in the habit of dating the contracts of private individuals by
reference to important national events. They appear to have chosen
by preference incidents in the religious life of the country; as, for
instance, the restoration of a temple, the annual enthronisation of one
of the great divinities, such as Shamash, Merodach, Ishtar, or Nana,
as the eponymous god of the current year, the celebration of a solemn
festival, or the consecration of a statue; while a few scattered
allusions to works of fortification show that meanwhile the defence of
the country was jealously watched over.* These sovereigns appear to have
enjoyed long reigns, the shortest extending over a period of five and
twenty years; and when at length the death of any king occurred, he was
immediately replaced by his son, the notaries' acts and the judicial
documents which have come down to us betraying no confusion or abnormal
delay in the course of affairs. We may, therefore, conclude that the
last century and a half of the dynasty was a period of peace and
of material prosperity. Chaldæa was thus enabled to fully reap the
advantage of being united under the rule of one individual. It is quite
possible that those cities&mdash;Uru, Larsa, Ishin, Uruk, and Nippur&mdash;which
had played so important a part in the preceding centuries, suffered from
the loss of their prestige, and from the blow dealt to their traditional
pretensions.
</p>
<pre>
     * Samsuîluna repaired the five fortresses which his ancestor
     Sumulaîlu had built. Contract dated "the year in which
     Ammisatana, the king, built Dur-Ammisatana, near the Sin
     river," and "the year in which Ammisatana, the king, gave
     its name to Dur-Iskunsin, near the canal of
     Ammisatana." Contract dated "the year in which the King
     Ammisatana repaired Dur-Iskunsin." Contract dated "the year in
     which Samsuîluna caused 'the wall of Uru and Uruk' to be
     built."

Up to this time they had claimed the privilege of controlling the
history of their country, and they had bravely striven among themselves
for the supremacy over the southern states; but the revolutions which
had raised each in turn to the zenith of power, had never exalted any
one of them to such an eminence as to deprive its rivals of all hope of
supplanting it and of enjoying the highest place. The rise of Babylon
destroyed the last chance which any of them had of ever becoming the
capital; the new city was so favourably situated, and possessed so much
wealth and so many soldiers, while its kings displayed such tenacious
energy, that its neighbours were forced to bow before it and resign
themselves to the subordinate position of leading provincial towns. They
gave a loyal obedience to the officers sent them from the north, and
sank gradually into obscurity, the loss of their political supremacy
being somewhat compensated for by the religious respect in which they
were always held. Their ancient divinities&mdash;Nana, Sin, Anu, and Ra&mdash;were
adopted, if we may use the term, by the Babylonians, who claimed the
protection of these gods as fully as they did that of Merodach or of
Nebo, and prided themselves on amply supplying all their needs. As the
inhabitants of Babylon had considerable resources at their disposal,
their appeal to these deities might be regarded as productive of more
substantial results than the appeal of a merely local kinglet. The
increase of the national wealth and the concentration, under one head,
of armies hitherto owning several chiefs, enabled the rulers, not
of Babylon or Larsa alone, but of the whole of Chaldæa, to offer
an invincible resistance to foreign enemies, and to establish their
dominion in countries where their ancestors had enjoyed merely a
precarious sovereignty. Hostilities never completely ceased between
Elam and Babylon; if arrested for a time, they broke out again in
some frontier disturbance, at times speedily suppressed, but at others
entailing violent consequences and ending in a regular war. No document
furnishes us with any detailed account of these outbreaks, but it
would appear that the balance of power was maintained on the whole with
tolerable regularity, both kingdoms at the close of each generation
finding themselves in much the same position as they had occupied at its
commencement. The two empires were separated from south to north by
the sea and the Tigris, the frontier leaving the river near the present
village of Amara and running in the direction of the mountains. Durîlu
probably fell ordinarily under Chaldæan jurisdiction. Umliyash was
included in the original domain of Kham-murabi, and there is no reason
to believe that it was evacuated by his descendants. There is every
probability that they possessed the plain east of the Tigris, comprising
Nineveh and Arbela, and that the majority of the civilized peoples
scattered over the lower slopes of the Kurdish mountains rendered them
homage. They kept the Mesopotamian table-land under their suzerainty,
and we may affirm, without exaggeration, that their power extended
northwards as far as Mount Masios, and westwards to the middle course of
the Euphrates.
</p>
<p>
At what period the Chaldæans first crossed that river is as yet unknown.
Many of their rulers in their inscriptions claim the title of suzerains
over Syria, and we have no evidence for denying their pretensions.
Kudur-mabug proclaims himself "adda" of Martu, Lord of the countries of
the West, and we are in the possession of several facts which suggest
the idea of a great Blamite empire, with a dominion extending for some
period over Western Asia, the existence of which was vaguely hinted
at by the Greeks, who attributed its glory to the fabulous Memnon.*
Contemporary records are still wanting which might show whether
Kudur-mabug inherited these distant possessions from one of his
predecessors&mdash;such as Kudur-nakhunta, for instance&mdash;or whether he
won them himself at the point of the sword; but a fragment of an old
chronicle, inserted in the Hebrew Scriptures, speaks distinctly of
another Elamite, who made war in person almost up to the Egyptian
frontier.** This is the Kudur-lagamar (Chedorlaomer) who helped Eimsin
against Hammurabi, but was unable to prevent his overthrow.
</p>
<pre>
     * We know that to Herodotus (v. 55) Susa was the city of
     Memnon, and that Strabo attributes its foundation to
     Tithonus, father of Memnon. According to Oppert, the word
     Memnon is the equivalent of the Susian Umman-anîn, "the
     house of the king:" Weissbach declares that "anin" does not
     mean king, and contradicts Oppert's view, though he does not
     venture to suggest a new explanation of the name.

     ** <i>Gen.</i> xiv. Prom the outset Assyriologists have never
     doubted the historical accuracy of this chapter, and they
     have connected the facts which it contains with those which
     seem to be revealed by the Assyrian monuments. The two
     Rawlinsons intercalate Kudur-lagamar between Kudur-nakhunta
     and Kudur-mabug, and Oppert places him about the same
     period. Fr. Lenormant regards him as one of the successors
     of Kudur-mabug, possibly his immediate successor. G. Smith
     does not hesitate to declare positively that the Kudur-mabug
     and Kudur-nakhunta of the inscriptions are one and the same
     with the Kudur-lagamar (Chedor-laomer) of the Bible.
     Finally, Schrader, while he repudiates Smith's view, agrees
     in the main fact with the other Assyriologists. On the other
     hand, the majority of modern Biblical critics have
     absolutely refused to credit the story in Genesis. Sayce
     thinks that the Bible story rests on an historic basis, and
     his view is strongly confirmed by Pinches'discovery of a
     Chaldæan document which mentions Kudur-lagamar and two of
     his allies. The Hebrew historiographer reproduced an
     authentic fact from the chronicles of Babylon, and connected
     it with one of the events in the life of Abraham. The very
     late date generally assigned to Gen. xiv. in no way
     diminishes the intrinsic probability of the facts narrated
     by the Chaldæan document which is preserved to us in the
     pages of the Hebrew book.
</pre>
<p>
In the thirteenth year of his reign over the East, the cities of the
Dead Sea&mdash;Sodom, Gomorrah, Adamah, Zeboîm, and Belâ&mdash;revolted against
him: he immediately convoked his great vassals, Amraphel of Chaldæa,
Ariôch of Ellasar,* Tida'lo the Guti, and marched with them to the
confines of his dominions. Tradition has invested many of the tribes
then inhabiting Southern Syria with semi-mythical names and attributes.
They are represented as being giants&mdash;Rephalm; men of prodigious
strength&mdash;Zuzîm; as having a buzzing and indistinct manner of
speech&mdash;Zamzummîm; as formidable monsters**&mdash;Emîm or Anakîm, before
whom other nations appeared as grasshoppers;*** as the Horîm who were
encamped on the confines of the Sinaitic desert, and as the Amalekites
who ranged over the mountains to the west of the Dead Sea. Kudur-lagamar
defeated them one after another&mdash;the Rephaîm near to Ashtaroth-Karnaîm,
the Zuzîm near Ham,**** the Amîm at Shaveh-Kiriathaim, and the Horîm
on the spurs of Mount Seir as far as El-Paran; then retracing
his footsteps, he entered the country of the Amalekites by way of
En-mishpat, and pillaged the Amorites of Hazazôn-Tamar.
</p>
<pre>
     * Ellasar has been identified with Larsa since the
     researches of Rawlin-son and Norris; the Goîm, over whom
     Tidal was king, with the Guti.

     ** Sayce considers Zuzîm and Zamzummîm to be two readings of
     the same word Zamzum, written in cuneiform characters on the
     original document. The sounds represented, in the Hebrew
     alphabet, by the letters m and w, are expressed in the
     Chaldæan syllabary by the same character, and a Hebrew or
     Babylonian scribe, who had no other means of telling the
     true pronunciation of a race-name mentioned in the story of
     this campaign, would have been quite as much at a loss as
     any modern scholar to say whether he ought to transcribe the
     word as Z-m-z-m or as Z-w-z-vo; some scribes read it
     <i>Zuzîm,</i> others preferred <i>Zamzummîm.</i>

     *** <i>Numb.</i> xiii. 33.

     **** In Deut. ii. 20 it is stated that the Zamzummîm lived
     in the country of Ammon. Sayce points out that we often find
     the variant Am for the character usually read <i>Ham</i> or
     <i>Kham</i>&mdash;the name Khammurabi, for instance, is often found
     written Ammurabi; the Ham in the narrative of Genesis would,
     therefore, be identical with the land of Ammon in
     Deuteronomy, and the difference between the spelling of the
     two would be due to the fact that the document reproduced in
     the XIVIIth chapter of Genesis had been originally copied from
     a cuneiform tablet in which the name of the place was
     expressed by the sign <i>Ham-Am.</i>
</pre>
<p>
In the mean time, the kings of the five towns had concentrated their
troops in the vale of Siddîm, and were there resolutely awaiting
Kudur-lagamar. They were, however, completely routed, some of the
fugitives being swallowed up in the pits of bitumen with which the
soil abounded, while others with difficulty reached the mountains.
Kudur-lagamar sacked Sodom and Gomorrah, re-established his dominion on
all sides, and returned laden with booty, Hebrew tradition adding
that he was overtaken near the sources of the Jordan by the patriarch
Abraham.*
</p>
<pre>
     * An attempt has been made to identify the three vassals of
     Kudur-lagamar with kings mentioned on the Chaldæan
     monuments. Tidcal, or, if we adopt the Septuagint variant,
     Thorgal, has been considered by some as the bearer of a
     Sumorian name, Turgal= "great chief," "great son," while
     others put him on one side as not having been a Babylonian;
     Pinches, Sayce, and Hommel identify him with Tudkhula, an
     ally of Kudur-lagamar against Khammurabi. Schrader was the
     first to suggest that Amraphel was really Khammurabi, and
     emended the Amraphel of the biblical text into Amraphi or
     Amrabi, in order to support this identification. Halévy,
     while on the whole accepting this theory, derives the name
     from the pronunciation Kimtarapashtum or Kimtarapaltum,
     which he attributes to the name generally read Khammurabi,
     and in this he is partly supported by Hommel, who reads
     "Khammurapaltu."
</pre>
<p>
After his victory over Kudur-lagamar, Khammurabi assumed the title of
King of Martu,* which we find still borne by Ammisatana sixty years
later.** We see repeated here almost exactly what took place in Ethiopia
at the time of its conquest by Egypt: merchants had prepared the way for
military occupation, and the civilization of Babylon had taken hold
on the people long before its kings had become sufficiently powerful
to claim them as vassals. The empire may be said to have been virtually
established from the day when the states of the Middle and Lower
Euphrates formed but one kingdom in the hands of a single ruler. We must
not, however, imagine it to have been a compact territory, divided into
provinces under military occupation, ruled by a uniform code of laws
and statutes, and administered throughout by functionaries of various
grades, who received their orders from Babylon or Susa, according as
the chances of war favoured the ascendency of Chaldæa or Elam. It was
in reality a motley assemblage of tribes and principalities, whose sole
bond of union was subjection to a common yoke.
</p>
<pre>
     * It is, indeed, the sole title which he attributes to
     himself on a stone tablet now in the British Museum.

     ** In an inscription by this prince, copied probably about
     the time of Nabonidus by the scribe Belushallîm, he is
     called "king of the vast land of Martu."
</pre>
<p>
They were under obligation to pay tribute, and furnish military
contingents and show other external marks of obedience, but their
particular constitution, customs, and religion were alike respected:
they had to purchase, at the cost of a periodical ransom, the right to
live in their own country after their own fashion, and the head of the
empire forbore all interference in their affairs, except in cases where
the internecine quarrels and dissensions threatened the security of his
suzerainty. Their subordination lasted as best it could, sometimes for a
year or for ten years, at the end of which period they would neglect
the obligations of their vassalage, or openly refuse to fulfil them:
a revolt would then break out at one point or another, and it was
necessary to suppress it without delay to prevent the bad example
from spreading far and wide. The empire was maintained by perpetual
re-conquests, and its extent varied with the energy shown by its chiefs,
or with the resources which were for the moment available.
</p>
<p>
Separated from the confines of the empire by only a narrow isthmus,
Egypt loomed on the horizon, and appeared to beckon to her rival. Her
natural fertility, the industry of her inhabitants, the stores of gold
and perfumes which she received from the heart of Ethiopia, were well
known by the passage to and fro of her caravans, and the recollection of
her treasures must have frequently provoked the envy of Asiatic courts.
Egypt had, however, strangely declined from her former greatness, and
the line of princes who governed her had little in common with the
Pharaohs who had rendered her name so formidable under the XIIth
dynasty. She was now under the rule of the Xoites, whose influence was
probably confined to the Delta, and extended merely in name over
the Said and Nubia. The feudal lords, ever ready to reassert their
independence as soon as the central power waned, shared between them the
possession of the Nile valley below Memphis: the princes of Thebes, who
were probably descendants of Usirtasen, owned the largest fiefdom, and
though some slight scruple may have prevented them from donning
the pschënt or placing their names within a cartouche, they assumed
notwithstanding the plenitude of royal power. A favourable opportunity
was therefore offered to an invader, and the Chaldæans might have
attacked with impunity a people thus divided among themselves.* They
stopped short, however, at the southern frontier of Syria, or if they
pushed further forward, it was without any important result: distance
from head-quarters, or possibly reiterated attacks of the Elamites,
prevented them from placing in the field an adequate force for such a
momentous undertaking. What they had not dared to venture, others more
audacious were to accomplish. At this juncture, so runs the Egyptian
record, "there came to us a king named Timaios. Under this king, then,
I know not wherefore, the god caused to blow upon us a baleful wind, and
in the face of all probability bands from the East, people of ignoble
race, came upon us unawares, attacked the country, and subdued it easily
and without fighting."
</p>
<pre>
     * The theory that the divisions of Egypt, under the XIVth
     dynasty, and the discords between its feudatory princes,
     were one of the main causes of the success of the Shepherds,
     is now admitted to be correct.
</pre>
<p>
It is possible that they owed this rapid victory to the presence
in their armies of a factor hitherto unknown to the African&mdash;the
war-chariot&mdash;and before the horse and his driver the Egyptians gave way
in a body.* The invaders appeared as a cloud of locusts on the banks of
the Nile. Towns and temples were alike pillaged, burnt, and ruined;
they massacred all they could of the male population, reduced to slavery
those of the women and children whose lives they spared, and then
proclaimed as king Salatis, one of their chiefs.** He established a
semblance of regular government, chose Memphis as his capital, and
imposed a tax upon the vanquished. Two perils, however, immediately
threatened the security of his triumph: in the south the Theban lords,
taking matters into their own hands after the downfall of the Xoites,
refused the oath of allegiance to Salatis, and organized an obstinate
resistance;*** in the north he had to take measures to protect
himself against an attack of the Chaldæans or of the Élamites who were
oppressing Chaldæa.****
</p>
<pre>
     * The horse was unknown, or at any rate had not been
     employed in. Egypt prior to the invasion; we find it,
     however, in general use immediately after the expulsion of
     the Shepherds, see the tomb of Pihiri. Moreover, all
     historians agree in admitting that it was introduced into
     the country under the rule of the Shepherds. The use of the
     war-chariot in Chaldæa at an epoch prior to the Hyksôs
     invasion, is proved by a fragment of the Vulture Stele; it
     is therefore, natural to suppose that the Hyksôs used the
     chariot in war, and that the rapidity of their conquest was
     due to it.

     ** The name Salatis (var. Saitôs) seems to be derived from a
     Semitic word, Siialît = "the chief," "the governor;" this
     was the title which Joseph received when Pharaoh gave him
     authority over the whole of Egypt (Gen. xli. 43). Salatis
     may not, therefore, have been the real name of the first
     Hyksôs king, but his title, which the Egyptians
     misunderstood, and from which they evolved a proper name:
     Uhlemann has, indeed, deduced from this that Manetho, being
     familiar with the passage referring to Joseph, had forged
     the name of Salatis. Ebers imagined that he could decipher
     the Egyptian form of this prince's name on the Colossus of
     Tell-Mokdam, where Naville has since read with certainty the
     name of a Pharaoh of the XIIIth and XIVth dynasties,
     Nahsiri.

     *** The text of Manetho speaks of taxes which he imposed on
     the high and low lands, which would seem to include the
     Thebaid in the kingdom; it is, however, stated in the next
     few pages that the successors of Salatis waged an incessant
     war against the Egyptians, which can only refer to
     hostilities against the Thebans. We are forced, therefore,
     to admit, either that Manetho took the title of lord of the
     high and low lands which belonged to Salatis, literally, or
     that the Thebans, after submitting at first, subsequently
     refused to pay tribute, thus provoking a war.

     **** Manetho here speaks of Assyrians; this is an error
     which is to be explained by the imperfect state of
     historical knowledge in Greece at the time of the Macedonian
     supremacy. We need not for this reason be led to cast doubt
     upon the historic value of the narrative: we must remember
     the suzerainty which the kings of Babylon exercised over
     Syria, and read <i>Chaldæans</i> where Manetho has written
     <i>Assyrians</i>. In Herodotus "Assyria" is the regular term for
     "Babylonia," and Babylonia is called "the land of the
     Assyrians."
</pre>
<p>
From the natives of the Delta, who were temporarily paralysed by their
reverses, he had, for the moment, little to fear: restricting himself,
therefore, to establishing forts at the strategic points in the Nile
valley in order to keep the Thebans in check, he led the main body of
his troops to the frontier on the isthmus. Pacific immigrations had
already introduced Asiatic settlers into the Delta, and thus prepared
the way for securing the supremacy of the new rulers; in the midst of
these strangers, and on the ruins of the ancient town of Hâwârît-Avaris,
in the Sethro'ifce nome&mdash;a place connected by tradition with the myth
of Osiris and Typhon&mdash;Salatis constructed an immense entrenched camp,
capable of sheltering two hundred and forty thousand men. He visited it
yearly to witness the military manoeuvres, to pay his soldiers, and
to preside over the distribution of rations. This permanent garrison
protected him from a Chaldæan invasion, a not unlikely event as long as
Syria remained under the supremacy of the Babylonian kings; it furnished
his successors also with an inexhaustible supply of trained soldiers,
thus enabling them to complete the conquest of Lower Egypt. Years
elapsed before the princes of the south would declare themselves
vanquished, and five kings&mdash;Anôn, Apachnas, Apôphis I., Iannas, and
Asses&mdash;passed their lifetime "in a perpetual warfare, desirous of
tearing up Egypt to the very root." These Theban kings, who were
continually under arms against the barbarians, were subsequently classed
in a dynasty by themselves, the XVth of Manetho, but they at last
succumbed to the invader, and Asses became master of the entire country.
His successors in their turn formed a dynasty, the XVIth, the few
remaining monuments of which are found scattered over the length and
breadth of the valley from the shores of the Mediterranean to the rocks
of the first cataract.
</p>
<p>
The Egyptians who witnessed the advent of this Asiatic people called
them by the general term Amûû, Asiatics, or Monâtiû, the men of the
desert.* They had already given the Bedouin the opprobrious epithet of
Shaûsû&mdash;pillagers or robbers&mdash;which aptly described them;** and they
subsequently applied the same name to the intruders&mdash;Hiq Shaûsû&mdash;from
which the Greeks derived their word Hyksôs, or Hykoussôs, for this
people.***
</p>
<pre>
     * The meaning of the term <i>Monîti</i> was discovered by E. de
     Rougé, who translated it <i>Shepherd</i>, and applied it to the
     Hyksôs; from thence it passed into the works of all the
     Egyptologists who concerned themselves with this question,
     but <i>Shepherd</i> has not been universally accepted as the
     meaning of the word. It is generally agreed that it was a
     generic term, indicating the races with which their
     conquerors were supposed to be connected, and not the
     particular term of which Manetho's word <i>Hoiveves</i> would be
     the literal translation.

     ** The name seems, in fact, to be derived from a word which
     meant "to rob," "to pillage." The name Shausu, Shosu, was
     not used by the Egyptians to indicate a particular race. It
     was used of all Bedouins, and in general of all the
     marauding tribes who infested the desert or the mountains.
     The Shausu most frequently referred to on the monuments are
     those from the desert between Egypt and Syria, but there is
     a reference, in the time of Ramses II., to those from the
     Lebanon and the valley of Orontes. Krall finds an allusion
     to them in a word (<i>Shosim</i>) in <i>Judges</i> ii. 14, which is
     generally translated by a generic expression, "the
     spoilers."

     *** Manetho declares that the people were called Hyksôs,
     from <i>Syk</i>, which means "king" in the sacred language, and
     <i>sôs</i>, which means "shepherd" in the popular language. As a
     matter of fact, the word <i>Hyku</i> means "prince "in the
     classical language of Egypt, or, as Manetho styles it, the
     <i>sacred language</i>, i.e. in the idiom of the old religious,
     historical, and literary texts, which in later ages the
     populace no longer understood. Shôs, on the contrary,
     belongs to the spoken language of the later time, and does
     not occur in the ancient inscriptions, so that Manetho's
     explanation is valueless; there is but one material fact to
     be retained from his evidence, and that is the name <i>Hyk-
     Shôs</i> or <i>Hyku-Shôs</i> given by its inventors to the alien
     kings. Cham-pollion and Rosellini were the first to identify
     these Shôs with the Shaûsû whom they found represented on
     the monuments, and their opinion, adopted by some, seems to
     me an extremely plausible one: the Egyptians, at a given
     moment, bestowed the generic name of Shaûsû on these
     strangers, just as they had given those of Amûû and Manâtiû.
     The texts or writers from whom Manetho drew his information
     evidently mentioned certain kings <i>hyku</i>-Shaûsû; other
     passages, or, the same passages wrongly interpreted, were
     applied to the race, and were rendered <i>hyku</i>-Shaûsû = "the
     <i>prisoners</i> taken from the Shaûsû," a substantive derived
     from the root <i>haka</i> = "to take" being substituted for the
     noun <i>hyqu</i> = "prince." Josephus declares, on the authority
     of Manetho, that some manuscripts actually suggested this
     derivation&mdash;a fact which is easily explained by the custom
     of the Egyptian record offices. I may mention, in passing,
     that Mariette recognised in the element "<i>Sôs</i>" an Egyptian
     word <i>shôs</i> = "soldiers," and in the name of King Mîrmâshâû,
     which he read Mîrshôsû, an equivalent of the title Hyq-
     Shôsû.
</pre>
<p>
But we are without any clue as to their real name, language, or origin.
The writers of classical times were unable to come to an agreement on
these questions: some confounded the Hyksôs with the Phoenicians, others
regarded them as Arabs.* Modern scholars have put forward at least
a dozen contradictory hypotheses on the matter. The Hyksôs have been
asserted to have been Canaanites, Elamites, Hittites, Accadians,
Scythians. The last opinion found great favour with the learned, as
long as they could believe that the sphinxes discovered by Mariette
represented Apôphis or one of his predecessors. As a matter of fact,
these monuments present all the characteristics of the Mongoloid type
of countenance&mdash;the small and slightly oblique eyes, the arched but
somewhat flattened nose, the pronounced cheekbones and well-covered
jaw, the salient chin and full lips slightly depressed at the corners.**
These peculiarities are also observed in the three heads found at
Damanhur, in the colossal torso dug up at Mit-Farês in the Fayum, in
the twin figures of the Nile removed to the Bulaq Museum from Tanis, and
upon the remains of a statue in the collection at the Villa Ludovisi in
Rome. The same foreign type of face is also found to exist among the
present inhabitants of the villages scattered over the eastern part
of the Delta, particularly on the shores of Lake Menzaleh, and the
conclusion was drawn that these people were the direct descendants of
the Hyksôs.
</p>
<pre>
     * Manetho takes them to be Phoenicians, but he adds that
     certain writers thought them to be Arabs: Brugsch favours
     this latter view, but the Arab legend of a conquest of Egypt
     by Sheddâd and the Adites is of recent origin, and was
     inspired by traditions in regard to the Hyksôs current
     during the Byzantine epoch; we cannot, therefore, allow it
     to influence us. We must wait before expressing a definite
     opinion in regard to the facts which Glaser believes he has
     obtained from the Minoan inscriptions which date from the
     time of the Hyksôs.

     ** Mariette, who was the first to describe these curious
     monuments, recognised in them all the incontestable
     characteristics of a Semitic type, and the correctness of
     his view was, at first, universally admitted. Later on Hamy
     imagined that he could distinguish traces of Mongolian
     influences, and Er. Lenormant, and then Mariette himself
     came round to this view; it has recently been supported in
     England by Flower, and in Germany by Virchow.
</pre>
<p>
This theory was abandoned, however, when it was ascertained that the
sphinxes of San had been carved, many centuries before the invasion, for
Amenemhâît III., a king of the XIIth dynasty. In spite of the facts we
possess, the problem therefore still remains unsolved, and the origin of
the Hyksôs is as mysterious as ever. We gather, however, that the third
millennium before our era was repeatedly disturbed by considerable
migratory movements. The expeditions far afield of Elamite and Chaldæan
princes could not have taken place without seriously perturbing the
regions over which they passed. They must have encountered by the
way many nomadic or unsettled tribes whom a slight shock would easily
displace. An impulse once given, it needed but little to accelerate
or increase the movement: a collision with one horde reacted on its
neighbours, who either displaced or carried others with them, and the
whole multitude, gathering momentum as they went, were precipitated in
the direction first given.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The Hyksôs invasion has been regarded as a natural result
     of the Elamite conquest.
</pre>
<p>
A tradition, picked up by Herodotus on his travels, relates that the
Phoenicians had originally peopled the eastern and southern shores of
the Persian Gulf;* it was also said that Indathyrses, a Scythian king,
had victoriously scoured the whole of Asia, and had penetrated as far as
Egypt.** Either of these invasions may have been the cause of the Syrian
migration. In. comparison with the meagre information which has come
down to us under the form of legends, it is provoking to think how much
actual fact has been lost, a tithe of which would explain the cause
of the movement and the mode of its execution. The least improbable
hypothesis is that which attributes the appearance of the Shepherds
about the XXIIIrd century B.C., to the arrival in Naharaim of those
Khati who subsequently fought so obstinately against the armies both of
the Pharaohs and the Ninevite kings. They descended from the mountain
region in which the Halys and the Euphrates take their rise, and if the
bulk of them proceeded no further than the valleys of the Taurus and the
Amanos, some at least must have pushed forward as far as the provinces
on the western shores of the Dead Sea. The most adventurous among them,
reinforced by the Canaanites and other tribes who had joined them on
their southward course, crossed the isthmus of Suez, and finding a
people weakened by discord, experienced no difficulty in replacing the
native dynasties by their own barbarian chiefs.***
</p>
<pre>
     * It was to the exodus of this race, in the last analysis,
     that the invasion of the shepherds may be attributed

     ** A certain number of commentators are of opinion that the
     wars attributed to Indathyrses have been confounded with
     what Herodotus tells of the exploits of Madyes, and are
     nothing more than a distorted remembrance of the great
     Scythian invasion which took place in the latter half of the
     VIIth century B.C.

     *** At the present time, those scholars who admit the
     Turanian origin of the Hyksôs are of opinion that only the
     nucleus of the race, the royal tribe, was composed of
     Mongols, while the main body consisted of elements of all
     kinds&mdash;Canaanitish, or, more generally, Semitic.

Both their name and origin were doubtless well known to the Egyptians,
but the latter nevertheless disdained to apply to them any term but that
of "she-maû,"* strangers, and in referring to them used the same
vague appellations which they applied to the Bedouin of the Sinaitic
peninsula,&mdash;Monâtiû, the shepherds, or Sâtiû, the archers. They
succeeded in hiding the original name of their conquerors so thoroughly,
that in the end they themselves forgot it, and kept the secret of it
from posterity.
</p>
<p>
The remembrance of the cruelties with which the invaders sullied their
conquest lived long after them; it still stirred the anger of Manetho
after a lapse of twenty centuries.** The victors were known as the
"Plagues" or "Pests," and every possible crime and impiety was attributed
to them.
</p>
<pre>
     * The term <i>shamamil,</i> variant of <i>sliemaû,</i> is applied to
     them by Queen Hâtshopsîtu: the same term is employed shortly
     afterward by Thutmosis III., to indicate the enemies whom he
     had defeated at Megiddo.

     ** He speaks of them in contemptuous terms as <i>men of
     ignoble race</i>. The epithet <i>Aîti, Iaîti, Iadîti</i>, was applied
     to the Nubians by the writer of the inscription of Ahmosi-
     si-Abîna, and to the Shepherds of the Delta by the author of
     the <i>Sallier Papyrus</i>. Brugsch explained it as "the rebels,"
     or "disturbers," and Goodwin translated it "invaders";
     Chabas rendered it by "plague-stricken," an interpretation
     which was in closer conformity with its etymological
     meaning, and Groff pointed out that the malady called Ait,
     or Adit in Egyptian, is the malignant fever still frequently
     to be met with at the present day in the marshy cantons of
     the Delta, and furnished the proper rendering, which is "The
     Fever-stricken."

<p>
But the brutalities attending the invasion once past, the invaders
soon lost their barbarity and became rapidly civilized. Those of them
stationed in the encampment at Avaris retained the military qualities
and characteristic energy of their race; the remainder became
assimilated to their new compatriots, and were soon recognisable merely
by their long hair, thick beard, and marked features. Their sovereigns
seemed to have realised from the first that it was more to their
interest to exploit the country than to pillage it; as, however, none of
them was competent to understand the intricacies of the treasury, they
were forced to retain the services of the majority of the scribes, who
had managed the public accounts under the native kings.* Once schooled
to the new state of affairs, they readily adopted the refinements of
civilized life.
</p>
<pre>
     * The same thing took place on every occasion when Egypt was
     conquered by an alien race: the Persian Achæmenians and
     Greeks made use of the native employés, as did the Romans
     after them; and lastly, the Mussulmans, Arabs, and Turks.
</pre>
<p>
The court of the Pharaohs, with its pomp and its usual assemblage of
officials, both great and small, was revived around the person of
the new sovereign;* the titles of the Amenemhâîts and the Usirtasens,
adapted to these "princes of foreign lands,"** legitimatised them as
descendants of Horus and sons of the Sun.*** They respected the
local religions, and went so far as to favour those of the gods whose
attributes appeared to connect them with some of their own barbarous
divinities. The chief deity of their worship was Baal, the lord of
all,**** a cruel and savage warrior; his resemblance to Sit, the brother
and enemy of Osiris, was so marked, that he was identified with the
Egyptian deity, with the emphatic additional title of Sutkhû, the Great
Sit.^
</p>
<pre>
     * The narrative of the <i>Sallier Papyrus,</i> No. 1, shows us
     the civil and military chiefs collected round the Shepherd-
     king Apôpi, and escorting him in the solemn processions in
     honour of the gods. They are followed by the scribes and
     magicians, who give him advice on important occasions.

     ** Hiqu Situ: this is the title of Abîsha at Beni-Hassan,
     which is also assumed by Khiani on several small monuments;
     Steindorff has attempted to connect it with the name of the
     Hyksôs.

     *** The preamble of the two or three Shepherd-kings of whom
     we know anything, contains the two cartouches, the special
     titles, and the names of Horus, which formed part of the
     title of the kings of pure Egyptian race; thus Apôphis IL is
     proclaimed to be the living Horus, who joins the two earths
     in peace, the good god, Aqnunrî, son of the Sun, Apôpi, who
     lives for ever, on the statues of Mîrmâshâu, which he had
     appropriated, and on the pink granite table of offerings in
     the Gizeh Museum.

     **** The name of Baal, transcribed Baâlu, is found on that
     of a certain Petebaâlû, "the Gift of Baal," who must have
     flourished in the time of the last shepherd-kings, or rather
     under the Theban kings of the XVIIth dynasty, who were their
     contemporaries, whose conclusions have been adopted by
     Brugsch.

     ^ Sutikhû, Sutkhû, are lengthened forms of Sûtû, or Sîtû;
     and Chabas, who had at first denied the existence of the
     final <i>Jehû</i>, afterwards himself supplied the philological
     arguments which proved the correctness of the reading: he
     rightly refused, however, to recognise in Sutikhû or Sutkhû
     &mdash;the name of the conquerors' god&mdash;a transliteration of the
     Phoenician Sydyk, and would only see in it that of the
     nearest Egyptian deity. This view is now accepted as the
     right one, and Sutkhû is regarded as the indigenous
     equivalent of the great Asiatic god, elsewhere called Baal,
     or supreme lord. [Professor Pétrie found a scarab bearing
     the cartouche of "Sutekh" Apepi I. at Koptos.&mdash;Te.]
</pre>
<p>
He was usually represented as a fully armed warrior, wearing a helmet
of circular form, ornamented with two plumes; but he also borrowed
the emblematic animal of Sît, the fennec, and the winged griffin which
haunted the deserts of the Thebaid. His temples were erected in the
cities of the Delta, side by side with the sanctuaries of the feudal
gods, both at Bubastis and at Tanis. Tanis, now made the capital,
reopened its palaces, and acquired a fresh impetus from the royal
presence within its walls. Apôphis Aq-nûnrî, one of its kings, dedicated
several tables of offerings in that city, and engraved his cartouches
upon the sphinxes and standing colossi of the Pharaohs of the XIIth and
XIIIth dynasties.

He was, however, honest enough to leave the inscriptions of his
predecessors intact, and not to appropriate to himself the credit of
works belonging to the Amenemhâîts or to Mirmâshâû. Khianî, who is
possibly the Iannas of Manetho, was not, however, so easily satisfied.*
The statue bearing his inscription, of which the lower part was
discovered by Naville at Bubastis, appears to have been really carved
for himself or for one of his contemporaries. It is a work possessing no
originality, though of very commendable execution, such as would render
it acceptable to any museum; the artist who conceived it took 'his
inspiration with considerable cleverness from the best examples
turned out by the schools of the Delta under the Sovkhotpfts and the
Nofirhotpûs. But a small grey granite lion, also of the reign of Khianî,
which by a strange fate had found its way to Bagdad, does not raise our
estimation of the modelling of animals in the Hyksôs period.
</p>
<pre>
     * Naville, who reads the name Râyan or Yanrâ, thinks that
     this prince must be the Annas or Iannas mentioned by Manetho
     as being one of the six shepherd-kings of the XVth dynasty.
     Mr. Pétrie proposed to read Khian, Khianî, and the fragment
     discovered at Gebeleîn confirms this reading, as well as a
     certain number of cylinders and scarabs. Mr. Pétrie prefers
     to place this Pharaoh in the VIIIth dynasty, and makes him
     one of the leaders in the foreign occupation to which he
     supposes Egypt to have submitted at that time; but it is
     almost certain that he ought to be placed among the Hyksôs
     of the XVIth dynasty. The name Khianî, more correctly
     Khiyanî or Kheyanî, is connected by Tomkins, and Hilprecht
     with that of a certain Khayanû or Khayan, son of Gabbar, who
     reigned in Amanos in the time of Salmanasar II., King of
     Assyria.

It is heavy in form, and the muzzle in no way recalls the fine profile
of the lions executed by the sculptors of earlier times. The pursuit
of science and the culture of learning appear to have been more
successfully perpetuated than the fine arts; a treatise on mathematics,
of which a copy has come down to us, would seem to have been recopied,
if not remodelled, in the twenty-second year of Apôphis IL Aûsirrî. If
we only possessed more monuments or documents treating of this period,
we should doubtless perceive that their sojourn on the banks of the
Nile was instrumental in causing a speedy change in the appearance and
character of the Hyksôs. The strangers retained to a certain extent
their coarse countenances and rude manners: they showed no aptitude for
tilling the soil or sowing grain, but delighted in the marshy expanses
of the Delta, where they gave themselves up to a semi-savage life
of hunting and of tending cattle. The nobles among them, clothed and
schooled after the Egyptian fashion, and holding fiefs, or positions at
court, differed but little from the native feudal chiefs. We see here a
case of what generally happens when a horde of barbarians settles down
in a highly organised country which by a stroke of fortune they may have
conquered; as soon as the Hyksôs had taken complete possession of Egypt,
Egypt in her turn took possession of them, and those who survived the
enervating effect of her civilization were all but transformed into
Egyptians.
</p>
<p>
If, in the time of the native Pharaohs, Asiatic tribes had been drawn
towards Egypt, where they were treated as subjects or almost as slaves,
the attraction which she possessed for them must have increased in
intensity under the shepherds. They would now find the country in the
hands of men of the same races as themselves&mdash;Egyptianised, it is true,
but not to such an extent as to have completely lost their own language
and the knowledge of their own extraction. Such immigrants were the more
readily welcomed, since there lurked a feeling among the Hyksôs that it
was necessary to strengthen themselves against the slumbering hostility
of the indigenous population. The royal palace must have more than once
opened its gates to Asiatic counsellors and favourites. Canaanites and
Bedouin must often have been enlisted for the camp at Avaris. Invasions,
famines, civil wars, all seem to have conspired to drive into Egypt not
only isolated individuals, but whole families and tribes. That of the
Beni-Israel, or Israelites, who entered the country about this time, has
since acquired a unique position in the world's history. They belonged
to that family of Semitic extraction which we know by the monuments
and tradition to have been scattered in ancient times along the western
shores of the Persian Gulf and on the banks of the Euphrates. Those
situated nearest to Chaldæa and to the sea probably led a settled
existence; they cultivated the soil, they employed themselves in
commerce and industries, their vessels&mdash;from Dilmun, from Mâgan, and
from Milukhkha&mdash;coasted from one place to another, and made their way to
the cities of Sumer and Accad. They had been civilized from very early
times, and some of their towns were situated on islands, so as to
be protected from sudden incursions. Other tribes of the same family
occupied the interior of the continent; they lived in tents, and
delighted in the unsettled life of nomads. There appeared to be in this
distant corner of Arabia an inexhaustible reserve of population, which
periodically overflowed its borders and spread over the world. It was
from this very region that we see the Kashdim, the true Chaldæans,
issuing ready armed for combat,&mdash;a people whose name was subsequently
used to denote several tribes settled between the lower waters of the
Tigris and the Euphrates. It was there, among the marshes on either side
of these rivers, that the Aramoans established their first settlements
after quitting the desert. There also the oldest legends of the race
placed the cradle of the Phoenicians; it was even believed, about the
time of Alexander, that the earliest ruins attributable to this people
had been discovered on the Bahrein Islands, the largest of which, Tylos
and Arados, bore names resembling the two great ports of Tyre and Arvad.
We are indebted to tradition for the cause of their emigration and the
route by which they reached the Mediterranean. The occurrence of violent
earthquakes forced them to leave their home; they travelled as far as
the Lake of Syria, where they halted for some time; then resuming their
march, did not rest till they had reached the sea, where they founded
Sidon. The question arises as to the position of the Lake of Syria on
whose shores they rested, some believing it to be the Bahr-î-Nedjif
and the environs of Babylon; others, the Lake of Bambykês near the
Euphrates, the emigrants doubtless having followed up the course of that
river, and having approached the country of their destination on its
north-eastern frontier. Another theory would seek to identify the lake
with the waters of Merom, the Lake of Galilee, or the Dead Sea; in this
case the horde must have crossed the neck of the Arabian peninsula,
from the Euphrates to the Jordan, through one of those long valleys,
sprinkled with oases, which afforded an occasional route for caravans.*
Several writers assure us that the Phoenician tradition of this exodus
was misunderstood by Herodotus, and that the sea which they remembered
on reaching Tyre was not the Persian Gulf, but the Dead Sea. If this had
been the case, they need not have hesitated to assign their departure to
causes mentioned in other documents. The Bible tells us that, soon after
the invasion of Kudur-lagamar, the anger of God being kindled by the
wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah, He resolved to destroy the five cities
situated in the valley of Siddim. A cloud of burning brimstone broke
over them and consumed them; when the fumes and smoke, as "of a
furnace," had passed away, the very site of the towns had disappeared.**
Previous to their destruction, the lake into which the Jordan empties
itself had had but a restricted area: the subsidence of the southern
plain, which had been occupied by the impious cities, doubled the size
of the lake, and enlarged it to its present dimensions. The earthquake
which caused the Phoenicians to leave their ancestral home may have been
the result of this cataclysm, and the sea on whose shores they sojourned
would thus be our Dead Sea.
</p>
<pre>
     * They would thus have arrived at the shores of Lake Merom,
     or at the shores either of the Dead Sea or of the Lake of
     Gennesareth; the Arab traditions speak of an itinerary which
     would have led the emigrants across the desert, but they
     possess no historic value is so far as these early epochs
     are concerned.

     ** <i>Gen.</i> xix. 24-29; the whole of this episode belongs to
     the Jehovistic narrative.
</pre>
<p>
One fact, however, appears to be certain in the midst of many
hypotheses, and that is that the Phoenicians had their origin in the
regions bordering on the Persian Gulf. It is useless to attempt, with
the inadequate materials as yet in our possession, to determine by what
route they reached the Syrian coast, though we may perhaps conjecture
the period of their arrival. Herodotus asserts that the Tyrians placed
the date of the foundation of their principal temple two thousand
three hundred years before the time of his visit, and the erection of a
sanctuary for their national deity would probably take place very soon
after their settlement at Tyre: this would bring their arrival there to
about the XXVIIIth century before our era. The Elamite and Babylonian
conquests would therefore have found the Phoenicians already established
in the country, and would have had appreciable effect upon them.
</p>
<p>
The question now arises whether the Beni-Israel belonged to the group of
tribes which included the Phoenicians, or whether they were of Chaldæan
race. Their national traditions leave no doubt upon that point. They are
regarded as belonging to an important race, which we find dispersed over
the country of Padan-Aram, in Northern Mesopotamia, near the base of
Mount Masios, and extending on both sides of the Euphrates.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The country of Padan-Aram is situated between the
     Euphrates and the upper reaches of the Khabur, on both sides
     of the Balikh, and is usually explained as the "plain" or
     "table-land" of Aram, though the etymology is not certain;
     the word seems to be preserved in that of Tell-Faddân, near
     Harrân.
</pre>
<p>
Their earliest chiefs bore the names of towns or of peoples,&mdash;N
akhor, Peleg, and Serug:* all were descendants of Arphaxad,** and it
was related that Terakh, the direct ancestor of the Israelites, had
dwelt in Ur-Kashdîm, the Ur or Uru of the Chaldæans.*** He is said to
have had three sons&mdash;Abraham, Nakhôr, and Harân. Harân begat Lot, but
died before his father in Ur-Kashdîm, his own country; Abraham and
Nakhor both took wives, but Abraham's wife remained a long time barren.
Then Terakh, with his son Abraham, his grandson Lot, the son of Harân,
and his daughter-in-law Sarah,**** went forth from Ur-Kashdîm (Ur of the
Chaldees) to go into the land of Canaan.
</p>
<pre>
     * Nakhôr has been associated with the ancient village of
     Khaura, or with the ancient village of Hâditha-en-Naura, to
     the south of Anah; Peleg probably corresponds with Phalga or
     Phaliga, which was situated at the mouth of the Khabur;
     Serug with the present Sarudj in the neighbourhood of
     Edessa, and the other names in the genealogy were probably
     borrowed from as many different localities.

     ** The site of Arphaxad is doubtful, as is also its meaning:
     its second element is undoubtedly the name of the Chaldæans,
     but the first is interpreted in several ways&mdash;"frontier of
     the Chaldæans," "domain of the Chaldæans." The similarity of
     sound was the cause of its being for a long time associated
     with the Arrapakhitis of classical times; the tendency is
     now to recognise in it the country nearest to the ancient
     domain of the Chaldæans, i.e. Babylonia proper.

     *** Ur-Kashdîm has long been sought for in the north, either
     at Orfa, in accordance with the tradition of the Syrian
     Churches still existing in the East, or in a certain Ur of
     Mesopotamia, placed by Ammianus Marcellinus between Nisibis
     and the Tigris; at the present day Halévy still looks for it
     on the Syrian bank of the Euphrates, to the south-east of
     Thapsacus. Rawlin-son's proposal to identify it with the
     town of Uru has been successively accepted by nearly all
     Assyriologists. Sayce remarks that the worship of Sin, which
     was common to both towns, established a natural link between
     them, and that an inhabitant of Uru would have felt more at
     home in Harrân than in any other town.

     **** The names of Sarah and Abraham, or rather the earlier
     form, Abram, have been found, the latter under the form
     Abirâmu, in the contracts of the first Chaldæan empire.
</pre>
<p>
And they came unto Kharân, and dwelt there, and Terakh died in Kharân.*
It is a question whether Kharân is to be identified with Harrân in
Mesopotamia, the city of the god Sin; or, which is more probable, with
the Syrian town of Haurân, in the neighbourhood of Damascus. The tribes
who crossed the Euphrates became subsequently a somewhat important
people. They called themselves, or were known by others, as the 'Ibrîm,
or Hebrews, the people from beyond the river;** and this appellation,
which we are accustomed to apply to the children of Israel only,
embraced also, at the time when the term was most extended, the
Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Ishmaelites, Midianites, and many other
tribes settled on the borders of the desert to the east and south of the
Dead Sea.
</p>
<pre>
     * Gen. xi. 27-32. In the opinion of most critics, verses 27,
     31 32 form part of the document which was the basis of the
     various narratives still traceable in the Bible; it is
     thought that the remaining verses bear the marks of a later
     redaction, or that they may be additions of a later date.
     The most important part of the text, that relating the
     migration from Ur-Kashdîm to Kharân, belongs, therefore, to
     the very oldest part of the national tradition, and may be
     regarded as expressing the knowledge which the Hebrews of
     the times of the Kings possessed concerning the origin of
     their race.

     ** The most ancient interpretation identified this nameless
     river with the Euphrates; an identification still admitted
     by most critics; others prefer to recognise it as being the
     Jordan. Halévy prefers to identify it with one of the rivers
     of Damascus, probably the Abana.
</pre>
<p>
These peoples all traced their descent from Abraham, the son of Terakh,
but the children of Israel claimed the privilege of being the only
legitimate issue of his marriage with Sarah, giving naïve or derogatory
accounts of the relations which connected the others with their common
ancestor; Ammon and Moab were, for instance, the issue of the incestuous
union of Lot and his daughters. Midian and his sons were descended from
Keturah, who was merely a concubine, Ishmael was the son of an Egyptian
slave, while the "hairy" Esau had sold his birthright and the primacy of
the Edomites to his brother Jacob, and consequently to the Israelites,
for a dish of lentils. Abraham left Kharân at the command of Jahveh, his
God, receiving from Him a promise that his posterity should be blessed
above all others. Abraham pursued his way into the heart of Canaan
till he reached Shechem, and there, under the oaks of Moreh, Jahveh,
appearing to him a second time, announced to him that He would give the
whole land to his posterity as an inheritance. Abraham virtually took
possession of it, and wandered over it with his flocks, building altars
at Shechem, Bethel, and Mamre, the places where God had revealed Himself
to him, treating as his equals the native chiefs, Abîmelech of Gerar and
Melchizedek of Jerusalem,* and granting the valley of the Jordan as
a place of pasturage to his nephew Lot, whose flocks had increased
immensely.** His nomadic instinct having led him into Egypt, he was here
robbed of his wife by Pharaoh.***
</p>
<pre>
     * Cf. the meeting with Melchizedek after the victory over
     the Elamites (<i>Gen</i>. xiv. 18-20) and the agreement with
     Abîmelech about the well (Gen. xxi. 22-34). The mention of
     the covenant of Abraham with Abîmelech belongs to the oldest
     part of the national tradition, and is given to us in the
     Jehovistic narrative. Many critics have questioned the
     historical existence of Melchizedek, and believed that the
     passage in which he is mentioned is merely a kind of parable
     intended to show the head of the race paying tithe of the
     spoil to the priest of the supreme God residing at
     Jerusalem; the information, however, furnished by the Tel-
     el-Amarna tablets about the ancient city of Jerusalem and
     the character of its early kings have determined Sayce to
     pronounce Melchizedek to be an historical personage.

     late with the people called on the Egyptian monuments
     Rotanu, or Lotanu, whom we shall have occasion to mention
     frequently further on: he is supposed to have been their
     eponymous hero. Lôtan, which is the name of an Edomite clan,
     (<i>Gen</i>. xxxvi. 20, 29), is a racial adjective, derived from
     Lot.

the cave of Machpelah, of which he made a burying-place for his family*
Kirjath-Arba, the Hebron of subsequent times, became from henceforward

Abraham set out in pursuit of them, and succeeded in delivering his
nephew.* God (Jahveh) not only favoured him on every occasion, but
expressed His will to extend over Abraham's descendants His sheltering
protection. He made a covenant with him, enjoining the use on the
occasion of the mysterious rites employed among the nations when
effecting a treaty of peace. Abraham offered up as victims a heifer, a
goat, and a three-year-old ram, together with a turtle-dove and a young
pigeon; he cut the animals into pieces, and piling them in two heaps,
waited till the evening. "And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep
fell upon Abraham; and lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him,"
and a voice from on high said to him: "Know of a surety that thy seed
shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them;
and they shall afflict them four hundred years; and also that nation,
whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out
with great substance.... And it came to pass, that when the sun went
down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that
passed between those pieces." Jahveh sealed the covenant by consuming the
offering.

Two less important figures fill the interval between the Divine
prediction of servitude and its accomplishment. The birth of one of
them, Isaac, was ascribed to the Divine intervention at a period when
Sarah had given up all hope of becoming a mother. Abraham was sitting
at his tent door in the heat of the day, when three men presented
themselves before him, whom he invited to repose under the oak while he
prepared to offer them hospitality. After their meal, he who seemed to
be the chief of the three promised to return within a year, when Sarah
should be blessed with the possession of a son. The announcement came
from Jahveh, but Sarah was ignorant of the fact, and laughed to herself
within the tent on hearing this amazing prediction; for she said, "After
I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?" The child
was born, however, and was called Isaac, "the laugher," in remembrance
of Sarah's mocking laugh.* There is a remarkable resemblance between his
life and that of his father.** Like Abraham he dwelt near Hebron,***
and departing thence wandered with his household round the wells of
Beersheba. Like him he was threatened with the loss of his wife.
</p>
<pre>
     * <i>Gen</i>. xviii. 1-16, according to the Jehovistic narrative.
     <i>Gen</i>. xvii. 15-22 gives another account, in which the
     Elohistic writer predicts the birth of Isaac in a différent
     way. The name of Isaac, "the laugher," possibly abridged
     from Isaak-el, "he on whom God smiles," is explained in
     three different ways: first, by the laugh of Abraham (ch.
     xvii. 17); secondly, by that of Sarah (xviii. 12) when her
     son's birth was foretold to her; and lastly, by the laughter
     of those who made sport of the delayed maternity of Sarah
     (xxi. 6).

     ** Many critics see in the life of Isaac a colourless copy
     of that of Abraham, while others, on the contrary, consider
     that the primitive episodes belonged to the former, and that
     the parallel portions of the two lives were borrowed from
     the biography of the son to augment that of his father.

Like him, also, he renewed relations with Abîmelech of Gerar.* He married
his relative Rebecca, the granddaughter of Nâkhor and the sister of
Laban.** After twenty years of barrenness, his wife gave birth to twins,
Esau and Jacob, who contended with each other from their mother's womb,
and whose descendants kept up a perpetual feud. We know how Esau, under
the influence of his appetite, deprived himself of the privileges of
his birthright, and subsequently went forth to become the founder of
the Edomites. Jacob spent a portion of his youth in Padan-Aram; here he
served Laban for the hands of his cousins Rachel and Leah; then, owing
to the bad faith of his uncle, he left him secretly, after twenty
years' service, taking with him his wives and innumerable flocks. At
first he wandered aimlessly along the eastern bank of the Jordan,
where Jahveh revealed Himself to him in his troubles. Laban pursued and
overtook him, and, acknowledging his own injustice, pardoned him for
having taken flight. Jacob raised a heap of stones on the site of
their encounter, known at Mizpah to after-ages as the "Stone of Witness
"&mdash;G-al-Ed (Galeed).*** This having been accomplished, his difficulties
began with his brother Esau, who bore him no good will.

     * <i>Gen.</i> xxvi. 1&mdash;31, Jehovistic narrative. In <i>Gen.</i> xxv.
     11 an Elohistic interpolation makes Isaac also dwell in the
     south, near to the "Well of the Living One Who seeth me."

     ** <i>Gen.</i> xxiv., where two narratives appear to have been
     amalgamated; in the second of these, Abraham seems to have
     played no part, and Eliezer apparently conducted Rebecca
     direct to her husband Isaac (vers. 61-67).

     *** <i>Gen.</i> xxxi. 45-54, where the writer evidently traces
     the origin of the word Gilead to Gal-Ed. We gather from the
     context that the narrative was connected with the cairn at
     Mizpah which separated the Hebrew from the Aramæan speaking
     peoples.

One night, at the ford of the Jabbok, when he had fallen behind his
companions, "there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the
day," without prevailing against him. The stranger endeavoured to escape
before daybreak, but only succeeded in doing so at the cost of giving
Jacob his blessing. "What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And he
said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast
striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed." Jacob called the
place Penîel, "for," said he, "I have seen God face to face, and my life
is preserved." The hollow of his thigh was "strained as he wrestled with
him," and he became permanently lame.* Immediately after the struggle
he met Esau, and endeavoured to appease him by his humility, building a
house for him, and providing booths for his cattle, so as to secure for
his descendants the possession of the land. From this circumstance the
place received the name of Succôth&mdash;the "Booths "&mdash;by which appellation
it was henceforth known. Another locality where Jahveh had met Jacob
while he was pitching his tents, derived from this fact the designation
of the "Two Hosts"&mdash;Mahanaîm.** On the other side of the river, at
Shechem,*** at Bethel,**** and at Hebron, near to the burial-place of
his family, traces of him are everywhere to be found blent with those of
Abraham.

     * <i>Gen.</i> xxxii. 22-32. This is the account of the Jehovistic
     writer. The Elohist gives a different version of the
     circumstances which led to the change of name from Jacob to
     Israel; he places the scene at Bethel, and suggests no
     precise etymology for the name Israel (<i>Gen.</i> xxxv. 9-15).

     xxxiv.). The almost complete dispersion of the two tribes of
     Simeon and Levi is attributed to this massacre: cf. <i>Gen.</i>
     xlix. 5-7.

<p>
By his two wives and their maids he had twelve sons. Leah was the mother
of Keuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zabulon; Gad. and Asher
were the children of his slave Zilpah; while Joseph and Benjamin were
the only sons of Rachel&mdash;Dan and Naphtali being the offspring of her
servant Bilhah. The preference which his father showed to him caused
Joseph to be hated by his brothers; they sold him to a caravan of
Midianites on their way to Egypt, and persuaded Jacob that a wild beast
had devoured him. Jahveh was, however, with Joseph, and "made all that
he did to prosper in his hand." He was bought by Potiphar, a great
Egyptian lord and captain of Pharaoh's guard, who made him his overseer;
his master's wife, however, "cast her eyes upon Joseph," but finding
that he rejected her shameless advances, she accused him of having
offered violence to her person. Being cast into prison, he astonished
his companions in misfortune by his skill in reading dreams, and was
summoned to Court to interpret to the king his dream of the seven lean
kine who had devoured the seven fat kine, which he did by representing
the latter as seven years of abundance, of which the crops should be
swallowed up by seven years of famine. Joseph was thereupon raised by
Pharaoh to the rank of prime minister. He stored up the surplus of the
abundant harvests, and as soon as the famine broke out, distributed
the corn to the hunger-stricken people in exchange for their silver and
gold, and for their flocks and fields. Hence it was,that the whole
of the Nile valley, with the exception of the lands belonging to the
priests, gradually passed into the possession of the royal treasury.
Meanwhile his brethren, who also suffered from the famine, came down
into Egypt to buy corn. Joseph revealed himself to them, pardoned the
wrong they had done him, and presented them to the Pharaoh. "And Pharaoh
said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts,
and go, get you unto the land of Canaan: and take your father and your
household, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of
Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land." Jacob thereupon raised his
camp and came to Beersheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God
of his father Isaac; and Jahveh commanded him to go down into Egypt,
saying, "I will there make of thee a great nation: I will go down with
thee into Egypt: and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph
shall put his hand upon thine eyes." The whole family were installed by
Pharaoh in the province of Goshen, as far as possible from the centres
of the native population, "for every shepherd is an abomination unto the
Egyptians."

<p>
In the midst of these stern yet touching narratives in which the Hebrews
of the times of the Kings delighted to trace the history of their remote
ancestors, one important fact arrests our attention: the Beni-Israel
quitted Southern Syria and settled on the banks of the Nile. They
had remained for a considerable time in what was known later as the
mountains of Judah. Hebron had served as their rallying-point; the broad
but scantily watered wadys separating the cultivated lands from the
desert, were to them a patrimony, which they shared with the inhabitants
of the neighbouring towns. Every year, in the spring, they led their
flocks to browse on the thin herbage growing in the bottoms of the
valleys, removing them to another district only when the supply of
fodder was exhausted. The women span, wove, fashioned garments, baked
bread, cooked the viands, and devoted themselves to the care of the
younger children, whom they suckled beyond the usual period. The men
lived like the Bedouin&mdash;periods of activity alternating regularly with
times of idleness, and the daily routine, with its simple duties and
casual work, often gave place to quarrels for the possession of some
rich pasturage or some never-failing well.
</p>
<p>
A comparatively ancient tradition relates that the Hebrews arrived in
Egypt during the reign of Aphôbis, a Hyksôs king, doubtless one of the
Apôpi, and possibly the monarch who restored the monuments of the Theban
Pharaohs, and engraved his name on the sphinxes of Amenemhâît III. and
on the colossi of Mîrmâshâû.* The land which the Hebrews obtained is
that which, down to the present day, is most frequently visited by
nomads, who find there an uncertain hospitality.
</p>
<pre>
     * The year XVII. of Apôphis has been pointed out as the date
     of their arrival, and this combination, probably proposed by
     some learned Jew of Alexandria, was adopted by Christian
     chroniclers. It is unsupported by any fact of Egyptian
     history, but it rests on a series of calculations founded on
     the information contained in the Bible. Starting from the
     assumption that the Exodus must have taken place under
     Ahmosîs, and that the children of Israel had been four
     hundred and thirty years on the banks of the Nile, it was
     found that the beginning of their sojourn fell under the
     reign of the Apôphis mentioned by Josephus, and, to be still
     more correct, in the XVIIth year of that prince.
</pre>
<p>
The tribes of the isthmus of Suez are now, in fact, constantly shifting
from one continent to another, and their encampments in any place are
merely temporary. The lord of the soil must, if he desire to keep them
within his borders, treat them with the greatest prudence and tact.
Should the government displease them in any way, or appear to curtail
their liberty, they pack up their tents and take flight into the desert.
The district occupied by them one day is on the next vacated and left to
desolation. Probably the same state of things existed in ancient times,
and the border nomes on the east of the Delta were in turn inhabited or
deserted by the Bedouin of the period. The towns were few in number,
but a series of forts protected the frontier. These were mere
village-strongholds perched on the summit of some eminence, and
surrounded by a strip of cornland. Beyond the frontier extended a region
of bare rock, or a wide plain saturated with the ill-regulated surplus
water of the inundation. The land of Goshen was bounded by the cities of
Heliopolis on the south, Bubastis on the west, and Tanis and Mendes on
the north: the garrison at Avaris could easily keep watch over it and
maintain order within it, while they could at the same time defend it
from the incursions of the Monatiû and the Hîrû-Shâîtû.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Goshen comprised the provinces situated on the borders of
     the cultivable cornland, and watered by the infiltration of
     the Nile, which caused the growth of a vegetation sufficient
     to support the flocks during a few weeks; and it may also
     have included the imperfectly irrigated provinces which were
     covered with pools and reedy swamps after each inundation.
</pre>
<p>
The Beni-Israel throve in these surroundings so well adapted to their
traditional tastes. Even if their subsequent importance as a nation
has been over-estimated, they did not at least share the fate of many
foreign tribes, who, when transplanted into Egypt, waned and died out,
or, at the end of two or three generations, became merged in the native
population.* In pursuing their calling as shepherds, almost within sight
of the rich cities of the Nile valley, they never forsook the God of
their fathers to bow down before the Enneads or Triads of Egypt; whether
He was already known to them as Jahveh, or was worshipped under the
collective name of Elohîm, they served Him with almost unbroken fidelity
even in the presence of Râ and Osiris, of Phtah and Sûtkhû.
</p>
<pre>
     * We are told that when the Hebrews left Ramses, they were
     "about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside
     children. And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and
     flocks and herds, even very much cattle" (<i>Exod.</i> xii. 37,
     38).
</pre>
<p>
The Hyksôs conquest had not in any way modified the feudal system of the
country. The Shepherd-kings must have inherited the royal domain just as
they found it at the close of the XIVth dynasty, but doubtless the whole
Delta, from Avaris to Sais, and from Memphis to Buto, was their personal
appanage. Their direct authority probably extended no further south than
the pyramids, and their supremacy over the fiefs of the Said was at best
precarious. The turbulent lords who shared among them the possession of
the valley had never lost their proud or rebellious spirit, and under
the foreign as under the native Pharaohs regulated their obedience
to their ruler by the energy he displayed, or by their regard for
the resources at his disposal. Thebes had never completely lost the
ascendency which it obtained over them at the fall of the Memphite
dynasty. The accession of the Xoite dynasty, and the arrival of the
Shepherd-kings, in relegating Thebes unceremoniously to a second rank,
had not discouraged it, or lowered its royal prestige in its own eyes or
in those of others: the lords of the south instinctively rallied around
it, as around their natural citadel, and their resources, combined with
its own, rendered it as formidable a power as that of the masters of the
Delta. If we had fuller information as to the history of this period, we
should doubtless see that the various Theban princes took occasion, as
in the Heracleopolitan epoch, to pick a quarrel with their sovereign
lord, and did not allow themselves to be discouraged by any check.*
</p>
<pre>
     * The length of time during which Egypt was subject to
     Asiatic rule is not fully known. Historians are agreed in
     recognizing the three epochs referred to in the narrative of
     Manetho as corresponding with (1) the conquest and the six
     first Hyksôs kings, including the XVth Theban dynasty; (2)
     the complete submission of Egypt to the XVIth foreign
     dynasty; (3) the war of independence during the XVIIth
     dynasty, which consisted of two parallel series of kings,
     the one Shepherds (Pharaohs), the other Thebans. There has
     been considerable discussion as to the duration of the
     oppression. The best solution is still that given by Erman,
     according to whom the XVth dynasty lasted 284, the XVIth
     234, and the XVIIth 143 years, or, in all, 661 years. The
     invasion must, therefore, have taken place about 2346 B.C.,
     or about the time when the Elamite power was at its highest.
     The advent of the XVIth dynasty would fall about 2062 B.C.,
     and the commencement of the war of independence between 1730
     and 1720 B.C.
</pre>
<p>
The period of hegemony attributed by the chronicles to the Hyksôs of the
XVIth dynasty was not probably, as far as they were concerned, years of
perfect tranquillity, or of undisputed authority. In inscribing their
sole names on the lists, the compilers denoted merely the shorter
or longer period during which their Theban vassals failed in their
rebellious efforts, and did not dare to assume openly the title or
ensigns of royalty. A certain Apôphis, probably the same who took the
prsenomen of Aqnûnrî, was reigning at Tanis when the decisive revolt
broke out, and Saqnûnrî Tiûâa I., who was the leader on the occasion,
had no other title of authority over the provinces of the south than
that of <i>hiqu,</i> or regent. We are unacquainted with the cause of the
outbreak or with its sequel, and the Egyptians themselves seem to have
been not much better informed on the subject than ourselves. They gave
free flight to their fancy, and accommodated the details to their taste,
not shrinking from the introduction of daring fictions into the account.
A romance, which was very popular with the literati four or five hundred
years later, asserted that the real cause of the war was a kind of
religious quarrel. "It happened that the land of Egypt belonged to
the Fever-stricken, and, as there was no supreme king at that time, it
happened then that King Saqnûnrî was regent of the city of the south,
and that the Fever-stricken of the city of Râ were under the rule of
Râ-Apôpi in Avaris. The Whole Land tribute to the latter in manufactured
products, and the north did the same in all the good things of the
Delta. Now, the King Râ-Apôpi took to himself Sûtkhû for lord, and he
did not serve any other god in the Whole Land except Sûtkhû, and he
built a temple of excellent and everlasting work at the gate of the King
Râ-Apôpi, and he arose every morning to sacrifice the daily victims,
and the chief vassals were there with garlands of flowers, as it was
accustomed to be done for the temple of Phrâ-Harmâkhis." Having finished
the temple, he thought of imposing upon the Thebans the cult of his god,
but as he shrank from employing force in such a delicate matter, he had
recourse to stratagem. He took counsel with his princes and generals,
but they were unable to propose any plan. The college of diviners and
scribes was more complaisant: "Let a messenger go to the regent of the
city of the South to tell him: The King Râ-Apôpi commands thee: 'That
the hippopotami which are in the pool of the town are to be exterminated
in the pool, in order that slumber may come to me by day and by night.'
He will not be able to reply good or bad, and thou shalt send him
another messenger: The King Râ-Apôpi commands thee: 'If the chief of the
South does not reply to my message, let him serve no longer any god but
Sûtkhû. But if he replies to it, and will do that which I tell him
to do, then I will impose nothing further upon him, and I will not in
future bow before any other god of the Whole Land than Amonrâ, king of
the gods!'" Another Pharaoh of popular romance, Nectanebo, possessed,
at a much later date, mares which conceived at the neighing of the
stallions of Babylon, and his friend Lycerus had a cat which went forth
every night to wring the necks of the cocks of Memphis:* the hippopotami
of the Theban lake, which troubled the rest of the King of Tanis, were
evidently of close kin to these extraordinary animals.
</p>
<pre>
     * Found in a popular story, which came in later times to be
     associated with the traditions connected with Æsop.
</pre>
<p>
The sequel is unfortunately lost. We may assume, however, without much
risk of error, that Saqnûnrî came forth safe and sound from the ordeal;
that Apôpi was taken in his own trap, and saw himself driven to the dire
extremity of giving up Sûtkhû for Amonrâ or of declaring war. He was
likely to adopt the latter alternative, and the end of the manuscript
would probably have related his defeat.

Hostilities continued for a century and a half from the time when
Saqnûnrî Tiûâa declared himself son of the Sun and king of the
two Egypts. From the moment in which he surrounded his name with a
cartouche, the princes of the Said threw in their lot with him, and the
XVIIth dynasty had its beginning on the day of his proclamation. The
strife at first was undecisive and without marked advantage to either
side: at length the Pharaoh whom the Greek copyists of Manetho call
Alisphragmouthosis, defeated the barbarians, drove them away from
Memphis and from the western plains of the Delta, and shut them up in
their entrenched camp at Avaris, between the Sebennytic branch of the
Nile and the Wady Tumilât. The monuments bearing on this period of
strife and misery are few in number, and it is a fortunate circumstance
if some insignificant object tarns up which would elsewhere be passed
over as unworthy of notice. One of the officials of Tiûâa I. has left us
his writing palette, on which the cartouches of his master are incised
with a rudeness baffling description.
</p>
<p>
We have also information of a prince of the blood, a king's son, Tûaû,
who accompanied this same Pharaoh in his expeditions; and the Gîzeh
Museum is proud of having in its possession the i wooden sabre which
this individual placed on the mummy of a certain Aqhorû, to enable him
to defend himself against the monsters of the lower world. A second
Saqnûnrî Tiûâa succeeded the first, and like him was buried in a little
brick pyramid on the border of the Theban necropolis. At his death the
series of rulers was broken, and we meet with several names which
are difficult to classify&mdash;Sakhontinibrî, Sanakhtû-niri, Hotpûrî,
Manhotpûrî, Eâhotpû.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Hotpûrî and Manhotpûrî are both mentioned in the fragments
     of a fantastic story (copied during the XXth dynasty), bits
     of which are found in most European museums. In one of these
     fragments, preserved in the Louvre, mention is made of
     Hotpûrî's tomb, certainly situated at Thebes; we possess
     scarabs of this king, and Pétrie discovered at Coptos a
     fragment of a stele bearing his name and titles, and
     describing the works which he executed in the temples of the
     town. The XIVth year of Manhotpûrî is mentioned in a passage
     of the story as being the date of the death of a personage
     born under Hotpûrî. These two kings belong, as far as we are
     able to judge, to the middle of the XVIIth dynasty; I am
     inclined to place beside them the Pharaoh Nûbhotpûrî, of
     whom we possess a few rather coarse scarabs.

As we proceed, however, information becomes more plentiful, and the list
of reigns almost complete. The part which the princesses of older
times played in the transmission of power had, from the XIIth dynasty
downward, considerably increased in importance, and threatened to
overshadow that of the princes. The question presents itself whether,
during these centuries of perpetual warfare, there had not been a moment
when, all the males of the family having perished, the women alone
were left to perpetuate the solar race on the earth and to keep the
succession unbroken. As soon as the veil over this period of history
begins to be lifted, we distinguish among the personages emerging from
the obscurity as many queens as kings presiding over the destinies of
Egypt. The sons took precedence of the daughters when both were the
offspring of a brother and sister born of the same parents, and when,
consequently, they were of equal rank; but, on the other hand, the sons
forfeited this equality when there was any inferiority in origin on the
maternal side, and their prospect of succession to the throne diminished
in proportion to their mother's remoteness from the line of Râ. In the
latter case all their sisters, born of marriages which to us appear
incestuous, took precedence of them, and the eldest daughter became the
legitimate Pharaoh, who sat in the seat of Horus on the death of her
father, or even occasionally during his lifetime. The prince whom she
married governed for her, and discharged those royal duties which could
be legally performed by a man only,&mdash;such as offering worship to the
supreme gods, commanding the army, and administering justice; but his
wife never ceased to be sovereign, and however small the intelligence
or firmness of which she might be possessed, her husband was obliged
to leave to her, at all events on certain occasions, the direction of
affairs.
</p>


<p>
At her death her children inherited the crown: their father had formally
to invest the eldest of them with royal, authority in the room of the
deceased, and with him he shared the externals, if not the reality, of
power.* It is doubtful whether the third Saq-nûnrî Tiûâa known to us&mdash;he
who added an epithet to his name, and was commonly known as Tiûâqni,
"Tiûâa the brave"** &mdash;united in his person all the requisites of a
Pharaoh qualified to reign in his own right. However this may have been,
at all events his wife, Queen Ahhotpû, possessed them.
</p>
<pre>
     * Thus we find Thûtmosis I. formally enthroning his daughter
     Hât-shopsîtû, towards the close of his reign.

     ** It would seem that the epithet Qeni ( = the brave, the
     robust) did not form an indispensable part of his name, any
     more than Ahmosi did of the names of members of the family
     of Ahmosis, the conqueror of the Shepherds. It is to him
     that the Tiûâa cartouche refers, which is to be found on the
     statue mentioned by Daninos-Pasha, published by Bouriant,
     and on which we find Ahmosis, a princess of the same name,
     together with Queen Ahhotpû I.
</pre>
<p>
His eldest son Ahmosû died prematurely; the two younger brothers, Kamosû
and a second Ahmosû, the Amosis of the Greeks, assumed the crown after
him. It is possible, as frequently happened, that their young sister
Ahmasi-Nofrîtari entered the harem of both brothers consecutively.

<p>
We cannot be sure that she was united to Kamosû, but at all events she
became the wife of Ahmosis, and the rights which she possessed, together
with those which her husband had inherited from their mother Ahhotpû,
gave him a legal claim such as was seldom enjoyed by the Pharaohs of
that period, so many of them being sovereigns merely <i>de facto,</i> while
he was doubly king by right.
</p>
<p>
Tiûâqni, Kamosû,* and Ahmosis** quickly succeeded each other. Tiûâqni
very probably waged war against the Shepherds, and it is not known
whether he fell upon the field of battle or was the victim of some plot;
the appearance of his mummy proves that he died a violent death when
about forty years of age. Two or three men, whether assassins or
soldiers, must have surrounded and despatched him before help was
available. A blow from an axe must have severed part of his left cheek,
exposed the teeth, fractured the jaw, and sent him senseless to the
ground; another blow must have seriously injured the skull, and a dagger
or javelin has cut open the forehead on the right side, a little above
the eye. His body must have remained lying where it fell for some
time: when found, decomposition had set in, and the embalming had to
be hastily performed as best it might. The hair is thick, rough, and
matted; the face had been shaved on the morning of his death, but by
touching the cheek we can ascertain how harsh and abundant the hair must
have been. The mummy is that of a fine, vigorous man, who might have
lived to a hundred years, and he must have defended himself resolutely
against his assailants; his features bear even now an expression of
fury. A flattened patch of exuded brain appears above one eye, the
forehead is wrinkled, and the lips, which are drawn back in a circle
about the gums, reveal the teeth still biting into the tongue. Kamosû
did not reign long;'we know nothing of the events of his life, but we
owe to him one of the prettiest examples of the Egyptian goldsmith's
art&mdash;the gold boat mounted on a carriage of wood and bronze, which
was to convey his double on its journeys through Hades. This boat was
afterwards appropriated by his mother Ahhotpû.
</p>
<pre>
     * With regard to Kamosû, we possess, in addition to the
     miniature bark which was discovered on the sarcophagus of
     Queen Ahhotpû, and which is now in the museum at Gîzeh, a
     few scattered references to his worship existing on the
     monuments, on a stele at Gîzeh, on a table of offerings in
     the Marseilles Museum, and in the list of princes worshipped
     by the "servants of the Necropolis." His pyramid was at Drah-
     Abu'l-Neggah, beside those of Ilûâa and Amenôthês I.

     ** The name Amosû or Ahmosi is usually translated "Child of
     the Moon-god" the real meaning is, "the Moon-god has brought
     forth," "him" or "her" (referring to the person who bears
     the name) being understood.
</pre>
<p>
Ahmosisa must have been about twenty-five years of age when he ascended
the throne; he was of medium height, as his body when mummied measured
only 5 feet 6 inches in length, but the development of the neck and
chest indicates extraordinary strength. The head is small in proportion
to the bust, the forehead low and narrow, the cheek-bones project, and
the hair is thick and wavy. The face exactly resembles that of Tiûâcrai,
and the likeness alone would proclaim the affinity, even if we were
ignorant of the close relationship which united these two Pharaohs.*
Ahmosis seems to have been a strong, active, warlike man; he was
successful in all the wars in which we know him to have been engaged,
and he ousted the Shepherds from the last towns occupied by them. It is
possible that modern writers have exaggerated the credit due to Ahmosis
for expelling the Hyksôs. He found the task already half accomplished,
and the warfare of his forefathers for at least a century must have
prepared the way for his success; if he appears to have played the most
important <i>rôle</i> in the history of the deliverance, it is owing to our
ignorance of the work of others, and he thus benefits by the oblivion
into which their deeds have passed. Taking this into consideration, we
must still admit that the Shepherds, even when driven into Avaris, were
not adversaries to be despised. Forced by the continual pressure of the
Egyptian armies into this corner of the Delta, they were as a compact
body the more able to make a protracted resistance against very superior
forces.
</p>
<pre>
     * Here again my description is taken from the present
     appearance of the mummy, which is now in the Gîzeh Museum.
     It is evident, from the inspection which I have made, that
     Ahmosis was about fifty years old at the time of his death,
     and, allowing him to have reigned twenty-five years, he must
     have been twenty-five or twenty-six when he came to the
     throne.

The impenetrable marshes of Menzaleh on the north, and the desert of the
Red Sea on the south, completely covered both their wings; the shifting
network of the branches of the Nile, together with the artificial
canals, protected them as by a series of moats in front, while Syria in
their rear offered them inexhaustible resources for revictualling their
troops, or levying recruits among tribes of kindred race. As long as
they could hold their ground there, a re-invasion was always possible;
one victory would bring them to Memphis, and the whole valley would
again fall under then-suzerainty. Ahmosis, by driving them from their
last stronghold, averted this danger. It is, therefore, not without
reason that the official chroniclers of later times separated him from
his ancestors and made him the head of a new dynasty.

His predecessors had in reality been merely Pharaohs on sufferance,
ruling in the south within the confines of their Theban principality,
gaining in power, it is true, with every generation, but never able to
attain to the suzerainty of the whole country. They were reckoned in
the XVIIth dynasty together with the Hyksôs sovereigns of uncontested
legitimacy, while their successors were chosen to constitute
the XVIIIth, comprising Pharaohs with full powers, tolerating no
competitors, and uniting under their firm rule the two regions of
which Egypt was composed&mdash;the possessions of Sit and the possessions of
Horus.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Manetho, or his abridgers, call the king who drove out the
     Shepherds Amôsis or Tethmôsis. Lepsius thought he saw
     grounds for preferring the second reading, and identified
     this Tethmôsis with Thûtmosi Manakhpirri, the ïhûtmosis III.
     of our lists; Ahmosis could only have driven out the greater
     part of the nation. This theory, to which Naville still
     adheres, as also does Stindorff, was disputed nearly fifty
     years ago by E. de Rougé; nowadays we are obliged to admit
     that, subsequent to the Vth year of Ahmosis, there were no
     longer Shepherd-kings in Egypt, even though a part of the
     conquering race may have remained in the country in a state
     of slavery, as we shall soon have occasion to observe.
</pre>
<p>
The war of deliverance broke out on the accession of Ahmosis, and
continued during the first five years of his reign.* One of his
lieutenants, the king's namesake&mdash;Âhmosi-si-Abîna&mdash;who belonged to the
family of the lords of Nekhabît, has left us an account, in one of the
inscriptions in his tomb, of the numerous exploits in which he took part
side by side with his royal master, and thus, thanks to this fortunate
record of his vanity, we are not left in complete ignorance of the
events which took place during this crucial struggle between the Asiatic
settlers and their former subjects. Nekhabît had enjoyed considerable
prosperity in the earlier ages of Egyptian history, marking as it
did the extreme southern limit of the kingdom, and forming an outpost
against the barbarous tribes of Nubia. As soon as the progress of
conquest had pushed the frontier as far south as the first cataract,
it declined in importance, and the remembrance of its former greatness
found an echo only in proverbial expressions or in titles used at the
Pharaonic court.* The nomes situated to the south of Thebes, unlike
those of Middle Egypt, did not comprise any extensive fertile or
well-watered territory calculated to enrich its possessors or to afford
sufficient support for a large population: they consisted of long strips
of alluvial soil, shut in between the river and the mountain range,
but above the level of the inundation, and consequently difficult to
irrigate.
</p>
<pre>
     * This is evident from passage in the biography of Ahmosi-
     si-Abîna, where it is stated that, after the taking of
     Avaris, the king passed into Asia in the year VI. The first
     few lines of the <i>Great Inscription of El-Kab</i> seem to refer
     to four successive campaigns, i.e. four years of warfare up
     to the taking of Avaris, and to a fifth year spent in
     pursuing the Shepherds into Syria.

     ** The vulture of Nekhabît is used to indicate the south,
     while the urseus of Buto denotes the extreme north; the
     title Râ-Nekhnît, "Chief of Nekhnît," which is,
     hypothetically, supposed to refer to a judicial function, is
     none the less associated with the expression, "Nekhabît-
     Tekhnît," as an indication of the south, and, therefore,
     can be traced to the prehistoric epoch when Nekhabît was the
     primary designation of the south.

These nomes were cultivated, moreover, by a poor and sparse population.
It needed a fortuitous combination of circumstances to relieve them from
their poverty-stricken condition&mdash;either a war, which would bring into
prominence their strategic positions; or the establishment of
markets, such as those of Syênê and Elephantine, where the commerce
of neighbouring regions would naturally centre; or the erection, as at
Ombos or Adfû, of a temple which would periodically attract a crowd
of pilgrims. The principality of the Two Feathers comprised, besides
Nekhabît, ât least two such towns&mdash;Anît, on its northern boundary, and
Nekhnît almost facing Nekhabît on the left bank of the river.* These
three towns sometimes formed separate estates for as many independent
lords:** even when united they constituted a fiefdom of but restricted
area and of slender revenues, its chiefs ranking below those of the
great feudal princes of Middle Egypt. The rulers of this fiefdom led an
obscure existence during the whole period of the Memphite empire, and
when at length Thebes gained the ascendency, they rallied to the latter
and acknowledged her suzerainty. One of them, Sovkûnakhîti, gained the
favour of Sovkhotpû III. Sakhemûaztaûirî, who granted him lands which
made the fortune of his house; another of them, Aï, married Khonsu,
one of the daughters of Sovkûmsaûf I. and his Queen Nûbkhâs, and it is
possible that the misshapen pyramid of Qûlah, the most southern in Egypt
proper, was built for one of these royally connected personages.
</p>
<pre>
     * Nekhnît is the Hieracônpolis of Greek and Roman times,
     Hâît-Baûkû, the modern name of which is Kom-el-Ahmar.

     ** Pihiri was, therefore, prince of Nekhabît and of Anît at
     one and the same time, whereas the town of Nekhnît had its
     own special rulers, several of whom are known to us from the
     tombs at Kom-el-Ahmar.
</pre>
<p>
The descendants of Aï attached themselves faithfully to the Pharaohs
of the XVIIth dynasty, and helped them to the utmost in their struggle
against the invaders. Their capital, Nekhabît, was situated between the
Nile and the Arabian chain, at the entrance to a valley which penetrates
some distance into the desert, and leads to the gold-mines on the Red
Sea. The town profited considerably from the precious metals brought
into it by the caravans, and also from the extraction of natron, which
from prehistoric times was largely employed in embalming. It had been
a fortified place from the outset, and its walls, carefully repaired
by successive ages, were still intact at the beginning of this century.
They described at this time a rough quadrilateral, the two longer sides
of which measured some 1900 feet in length, the two shorter being about
one-fourth less. The southern face was constructed in a fashion common
in brick buildings in Egypt, being divided into alternate panels of
horizontally laid courses, and those in which the courses were concave;
on the north and west façades the bricks were so laid as to present
an undulating arrangement running uninterruptedly from one end to the
other. The walls are 33 feet thick, and their average height 27 feet;
broad and easy steps lead to the foot-walk on the top. The gates are
unsymmetrically placed, there being one on the north, east, and west
sides respectively; while the southern side is left without an opening.
These walls afforded protection to a dense but unequally distributed
population, the bulk of which was housed towards the north and west
sides, where the remains of an immense number of dwellings may still
be seen. The temples were crowded together in a small square enclosure,
concentric with the walls of the enceinte, and the principal sanctuary
was dedicated to Nekhabît, the vulture goddess, who gave her name to the
city.* This enclosure formed a kind of citadel, where the garrison could
hold out when the outer part had fallen into the enemy's hands. The
times were troublous; the open country was repeatedly wasted by war, and
the peasantry had more than once to seek shelter behind the protecting
ramparts of the town, leaving their lands to lie fallow.
</p>
<pre>
     * A part of the latter temple, that which had been rebuilt
     in the Saîte epoch, was still standing at the beginning of
     the XIXth century, with columns bearing the cartouches of
     Hakori; it was destroyed about the year 1825, and
     Champollion found only the foundations of the walls.

<p>
Famine constantly resulted from these disturbances, and it taxed all the
powers of the ruling prince to provide at such times for his people. A
chief of the Commissariat, Bebî by name, who lived about this period,
gives us a lengthy account of the number of loaves, oxen, goats, and
pigs, which he allowed to all the inhabitants both great and little,
down even to the quantity of oil and incense, which he had taken care to
store up for them: his prudence was always justified by the issue, for
"during the many years in which the famine recurred, he distributed
grain in the city to all those who hungered."
</p>
<p>
Babaî, the first of the lords of El-Kab whose name has come down to
us, was a captain in the service of Saqnûnrî Tiûâqni.* His son Ahmosi,
having approached the end of his career, cut a tomb for himself in the
hill which overlooks the northern side of the town. He relates on
the walls of his sepulchre, for the benefit of posterity, the most
praiseworthy actions of his long life. He had scarcely emerged from
childhood when he was called upon to act for his father, and before his
marriage he was appointed to the command of the barque <i>The Calf.</i> From
thence he was promoted to the ship <i>The North</i>, and on account of his
activity he was chosen to escort his namesake the king on foot, whenever
he drove in his chariot. He repaired to his post at the moment when the
decisive war against the Hyksôs broke out.
</p>
<pre>
     * There are still some doubts as to the descent of this
     Ahmosi. Some authorities hold that Babai was the name of his
     father and Abîna that of his grandfather; others think that
     Babai was his father and Abîna his mother; others, again,
     make out Babai and Abîna to be variants of the same name,
     probably a Semitic one, borne by the father of Ahmosi; the
     majority of modern Egyptologists (including myself) regard
     this last hypothesis as being the most probable one.
</pre>
<p>
The tradition current in the time of the Ptolemies reckoned the number
of men under the command of King Ahmosis when he encamped before
Avaris at 480,000. This immense multitude failed to bring matters to a
successful issue, and the siege dragged on indefinitely. The king afc
length preferred to treat with the Shepherds, and gave them permission
to retreat into Syria safe and sound, together with their wives, their
children, and all their goods. This account, however, in no way agrees
with the all too brief narration of events furnished by the inscription
in the tomb. The army to which Egypt really owed its deliverance was
not the undisciplined rabble of later tradition, but, on the contrary,
consisted of troops similar to those which subsequently invaded Syria,
some 15,000 to 20,000 in number, fully equipped and ably officered,
supported, moreover, by a fleet ready to transfer them across the canals
and arms of the river in a vigorous condition and ready for the battle.*
</p>
<pre>
     * It may be pointed out that Ahmosi, son of Abîna, was a
     sailor and a leader of sailors; that he passed from one
     vessel to another, until he was at length appointed to the
     command of one of the most important ships in the royal
     fleet. Transport by water always played considerable part in
     the wars which were carried on in Egyptian territory; I have
     elsewhere drawn attention to campaigns conducted in this
     manner under the Horacleopolitan dynasties, and we shall see
     that the Ethiopian conquerors adopted the same mode of
     transit in the course of their invasion of Egypt.
</pre>
<p>
As soon as this fleet arrived at the scene of hostilities, the
engagement began. Ahmosi-si-Abîna conducted the manouvres under the
king's eye, and soon gave such evidence of his capacity, that he was
transferred by royal favour to the <i>Rising in Memphis</i>&mdash;a vessel with
a high freeboard. He was shortly afterwards appointed to a post in a
division told off for duty on the river Zadiku, which ran under the
walls of the enemy's fortress.* Two successive and vigorous attacks
made in this quarter were barren of important results. Ahmosi-si-Abîna
succeeded in each of the attacks in killing an enemy, bringing back as
trophies a hand of each of his victims, and his prowess, made known to
the king by one of the heralds, twice procured for him, "the gold of
valour," probably in the form of collars, chains, or bracelets.**
</p>
<pre>
     * The name of this canal was first recognised by Brugsch,
     then misunderstood and translated "the water bearing the
     name of the water of Avaris." It is now road "Zadikû," and,
     with the Egyptian article, Pa-zadikû, or Pzadikû. The name
     is of Semitic origin, and is derived from the root meaning
     "to be just;" we do not know to which of the watercourses
     traversing the east of the Delta it ought to be applied.

     ** The fact that the attacks from this side were not
     successful is proved by the sequel. If they had succeeded,
     as is usually supposed, the Egyptians would not have fallen
     back on another point further south in order to renew the
     struggle.

<p>
The assault having been repulsed in this quarter, the Egyptians made
their way towards the south, and came into conflict with the enemy at
the village of Taqimît.* Here, again, the battle remained undecided,
but Ahmosi-si-Abîna had an adventure. He had taken a prisoner, and in
bringing him back lost himself, fell into a muddy ditch, and, when he
had freed himself from the dirt as well as he could, pursued his way
by mistake for some time in the direction of Avaris. He found out his
error, however, before it was too late, came back to the camp safe
and sound, and received once more some gold as a reward of his brave
conduct. A second attack upon the town was crowned with complete
success; it was taken by storm, given over to pillage, and
Ahmosi-si-Abîna succeeded in capturing one man and three women, who were
afterwards, at the distribution of the spoil, given to him as slaves.**
The enemy evacuated in haste the last strongholds which they held in
the east of the Delta, and took refuge in the Syrian provinces on the
Egyptian frontier. Whether it was that they assumed here a menacing
attitude, or whether Ahmosis hoped to deal them a crushing blow before
they could find time to breathe, or to rally around them sufficient
forces to renew the offensive, he made up his mind to cross the
frontier, which he did in the 5th year of his reign.
</p>
<pre>
     * The site of Taqimît is unknown.

     ** The prisoner who was given to Ahmosis after the victory,
     is probably Paâmû, the Asiatic, mentioned in the list of his
     slaves which he had engraved on one of the walls of his
     tomb.
</pre>
<p>
It was the first time for centuries that a Pharaoh had trusted himself
in Asia, and the same dread of the unknown which had restrained his
ancestors of the XIIth dynasty, doubtless arrested Ahmosis also on the
threshold of the continent. He did not penetrate further than the border
provinces of Zahi, situated on the edge of the desert, and contented
himself with pillaging the little town of Sharûhana.* Ahmosi-si-Abîna
was again his companion, together with his cousin, Ahmosi-Pannekhabit,
then at the beginning of his career, who brought away on this occasion
two young girls for his household.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Sharûhana, which is mentioned again under Thûtmosis III.
     is not the plain of Sharon, as Birch imagined, but the
     Sharuhen of the Biblical texts, in the tribe of Simeon
     (<i>Josh.</i> xix. 6), as Brugsch recognised it to be. It is
     probably identical with the modern Tell-esh-Sheriâh, which
     lies north-west of Beersheba.

     ** Ahmosi Pannekhabit lay in tomb No. 2, at El-Kab. His
     history is briefly told on one of the walls, and on two

     or rather two plates from the pedestal of one of them, in

     mutilated condition on the wall of the tomb, but the three

     complementary to one another to enable us to restore nearly
     the whole of the original text.

The expedition having accomplished its purpose, the Egyptians returned
home with their spoil, and did not revisit Asia for a long period. If
the Hyksôs generals had fostered in their minds the idea that they could
recover their lost ground, and easily re-enter upon the possession of
their African domain, this reverse must have cruelly disillusioned them.
They must have been forced to acknowledge that their power was at an
end, and to renounce all hope of returning to the country which had so
summarily ejected them. The majority of their own people did not follow
them into exile, but remained attached to the soil on which they
lived, and the tribes which had successively settled down beside
them&mdash;including the Beni-Israel themselves&mdash;no longer dreamed of
a return to their fatherland. The condition of these people varied
according to their locality. Those who had taken up a position in the
plain of the Delta were subjected to actual slavery. Ahmosis destroyed
the camp at Avails, quartered his officers in the towns, and constructed
forts at strategic points, or rebuilt the ancient citadels to resist the
incursions of the Bedouin. The vanquished people in the Delta, hemmed in
as they were by a network of fortresses, were thus reduced to a rabble
of serfs, to be taxed and subjected to the <i>corvée</i> without mercy.
But further north, the fluctuating population which roamed between the
Sebennytic and Pelusiac branches of the Nile were not exposed to such
rough treatment. The marshes of the coast-line afforded them a safe
retreat, in which they could take refuge at the first threat of
exactions on the part of the royal emissaries. Secure within dense
thickets, upon islands approached by interminable causeways, often
covered with water, or by long tortuous canals concealed in the thick
growth of reeds, they were able to defy with impunity the efforts of the
most disciplined troops, and treason alone could put them at the mercy
of their foes. Most of the Pharaohs felt that the advantages to be
gained by conquering them would be outweighed by the difficulty of
the enterprise; all that could result from a campaign would be the
destruction of one or two villages, the acquisition of a few hundred
refractory captives, of some ill-favoured cattle, and a trophy of nets
and worm-eaten boats. The kings, therefore, preferred to keep a close
watch over these undisciplined hordes, and as long as their depredations
were kept within reasonable limits, they were left unmolested to their
wild and precarious life.
</p>
<p>
The Asiatic invasion had put a sudden stop to the advance of Egyptian
rule in the vast plains of the Upper Nile. The Theban princes, to whom
Nubia was directly subject, had been too completely engrossed in
the wars against their hereditary enemy, to devote much time to the
continuation of that work of colonization in the south which had been
carried on so vigorously by their forefathers of the XIIth and XIIIth
dynasties. The inhabitants of the Nile valley, as far as the second
cataract, rendered them obedience, but without any change in the
conditions and mode of their daily life, which appear to have remained
unaltered for centuries. The temples of Usirtasen and Amenemhaît
were allowed to fall into decay one after another, the towns waned in
prosperity, and were unable to keep their buildings and monuments in
repair; the inundation continued to bring with it periodically its
fleet of boats, which the sailors of Kûsh had laden with timber, gum,
elephants' tusks, and gold dust: from time to time a band of Bedouin from
Uaûaît or Mazaiû would suddenly bear down upon some village and carry
off its spoils; the nearest garrison would be called to its aid, or, on
critical occasions, the king himself, at the head of his guards, would
fall on the marauders and drive them back into the mountains. Ahrnosis,
being greeted on his return from Syria by the news of such an outbreak,
thought it a favourable moment to impress upon the nomadic tribes of
Nubia the greatness of his conquest. On this occasion it was the people
of Khonthanûnofir, settled in the wadys east of the Nile, above Semneh,
which required a lesson. The army which had just expelled the Hyksôs was
rapidly conveyed to the opposite borders of the country by the fleet,
the two Ahmosi of Nekhabît occupying the highest posts. The Egyptians,
as was customary, landed at the nearest point to the enemy's territory,
and succeeded in killing a few of the rebels. Ahmosi-si-Abîna brought
back two prisoners and three hands, for which he was rewarded by a gift
of two female Bedouin slaves, besides the "gold of valour." This victory
in the south following on such decisive success in the north, filled the
heart of the Pharaoh with pride, and the view taken of it by those who
surrounded him is evident even in the brief sentences of the narrative.
He is described as descending the river on the royal galley, elated
in spirit and flushed by his triumph in Nubia, which had followed so
closely on the deliverance of the Delta. But scarcely had he reached
Thebes, when an unforeseen catastrophe turned his confidence into alarm,
and compelled him to retrace his steps. It would appear that at the
very moment when he was priding himself on the successful issue of his
Ethiopian expedition, one of the sudden outbreaks, which frequently
occurred in those regions, had culminated in a Sudanese invasion of
Egypt. We are not told the name of the rebel leader, nor those of the
tribes who took part in it. The Egyptian people, threatened in a moment
of such apparent security by this inroad of barbarians, regarded them
as a fresh incursion of the Hyksôs, and applied to these southerners
the opprobrious term of "Fever-stricken," already used to denote their
Asiatic conquerors. The enemy descended the Nile, committing terrible
atrocities, and polluting every sanctuary of the Theban gods which came
within their reach. They had reached a spot called Tentoâ,* before they
fell in with the Egyptian troops. Ahmosi-si-Abîna again distinguished
himself in the engagement. The vessel which he commanded, probably the
<i>Rising in Memphis</i>, ran alongside the chief galliot of the Sudanese
fleet, and took possession of it after a struggle, in which Ahmosi
made two of the enemy's sailors prisoners with his own hand. The king
generously rewarded those whose valour had thus turned the day in his
favour, for the danger had appeared to him critical; he allotted to
every man on board the victorious vessel five slaves, and five ancra of
land situated in his native province of each respectively. The invasion
was not without its natural consequences to Egypt itself.
</p>
<pre>
     * The name of this locality does not occur elsewhere; it
     would seem to refer, not to a village, but rather to a
     canal, or the branch of a river, or a harbour somewhere
     along the Nile. I am unable to locate it definitely, but am
     inclined to think we ought to look for it, if not in Egypt
     itself, at any rate in that part of Nubia which is nearest
     to Egypt. M. Revillout, taking up a theory which had been
     abandoned by Chabas, recognising in this expedition an
     offensive incursion of the Shepherds, suggests that Tantoâ
     may be the modern Tantah in the Delta.
</pre>
<p>
A certain Titiânu, who appears to have been at the head of a powerful
faction, rose in rebellion at some place not named in the narrative, but
in the rear of the army. The rapidity with which Ahmosis repulsed the
Nubians, and turned upon his new enemy, completely baffled the latter's
plans, and he and his followers were cut to pieces, but the danger
had for the moment been serious.* It was, if not the last expedition
undertaken in this reign, at least the last commanded by the Pharaoh in
person. By his activity and courage Ahmosis had well earned the right to
pass the remainder of his days in peace.
</p>
<pre>
     * The wording of the text is so much condensed that it is
     difficult to be sure of its moaning. Modern scholars agree
     with Brugsch that Titiânu is the name of a man, but several
     Egyptologists believe its bearer to have been chief of the
     Ethiopian tribes, while others think him to have been a
     rebellious Egyptian prince, or a king of the Shepherds, or
     give up the task of identification in despair. The tortuous
     wording of the text, and the expressions which occur in it,
     seem to indicate that the rebel was a prince of the royal
     blood, and even that the name he bears was not his real one.
     Later on we shall find that, on a similar occasion, the
     official documents refer to a prince who took part in a plot
     against Ramses III. by the fictitious name of Pentauîrît;
     Titiânu was probably a nickname of the same kind inserted in
     place of the real name. It seems that, in cases of high
     treason, the criminal not only lost his life, but his name
     was proscribed both in this world and in the next.

A revival of military greatness always entailed a renaissance in art,
followed by an age of building activity. The claims of the gods upon the
spoils of war must be satisfied before those of men, because the victory
and the booty obtained through it were alike owing to the divine help
given in battle. A tenth, therefore, of the slaves, cattle, and precious
metals was set apart for the service of the gods, and even fields,
towns, and provinces were allotted to them, the produce of which was
applied to enhance the importance of their cult or to repair and enlarge
their temples. The main body of the building was strengthened, halls and
pylons were added to the original plan, and the impulse once given to
architectural work, the co-operation of other artificers soon
followed. Sculptors and painters whose art had been at a standstill for
generations during the centuries of Egypt's humiliation, and whose
hands had lost their cunning for want of practice, were now once more in
demand. They had probably never completely lost the technical knowledge
of their calling, and the ancient buildings furnished them with various
types of models, which they had but to copy faithfully in order to
revive their old traditions. A few years after this revival a new school
sprang up, whose originality became daily more patent, and whose leaders
soon showed themselves to be in no way inferior to the masters of the
older schools. Ahmosis could not be accused of ingratitude to the gods;
as soon as his wars allowed him the necessary leisure, he began his work
of temple-building. The accession to power of the great Theban families
had been of little advantage to Thebes itself. Its Pharaohs, on assuming
the sovereignty of the whole valley, had not hesitated to abandon their
native city, and had made Heracleopolis, the Fayum or even Memphis,
their seat of government, only returning to Thebes in the time of the
XIIIth dynasty, when the decadence of their power had set in. The honour
of furnishing rulers for its country had often devolved on Thebes,
but the city had reaped but little benefit from the fact; this time,
however, the tide of fortune was to be turned. The other cities of Egypt
had come to regard Thebes as their metropolis from the time when they
had temples. The main body of the building was strengthened, halls and

<p>
The other cities of Egypt had come to regard Thebes as their metropolis
from the time when they had learned to rally round its princes to wage
war against the Hyksôs. It had been the last town to lay down arms at
the time of the invasion, and the first to take them up again in the
struggle for liberty. Thus the Egypt which vindicated her position among
the nations of the world was not the Egypt of the Memphite dynasties. It
was the great Egypt of the Amenemhâîts and the Usirtasens, still further
aggrandised by recent victories. Thebes was her natural capital, and
its kings could not have chosen a more suitable position from whence to
command effectually the whole empire. Situated at an equal distance from
both frontiers, the Pharaoh residing there, on the outbreak of a war
either in the north or south, had but half the length of the country to
traverse in order to reach the scene of action. Ahmosis spared no pains
to improve the city, but his resources did not allow of his embarking on
any very extensive schemes; he did not touch the temple of Amon, and
if he undertook any buildings in its neighbourhood, they must have been
minor edifices. He could, indeed, have had but little leisure to attempt
much else, for it was not till the XXIInd year of his reign that he was
able to set seriously to work.*
</p>
<pre>
     * In the inscription of the year XXII., Âhmosis expressly
     states that he opened new chambers in the quarries of Tûrah
     for the works in connection with the Theban Amon, as well as
     for those of the temple of the Memphite Phtah.
</pre>
<p>
An opportunity then occurred to revive a practice long fallen into
disuse under the foreign kings, and to set once more in motion an
essential part of the machinery of Egyptian administration. The quarries
of Turah, as is well known, enjoyed the privilege of furnishing the
finest materials to the royal architects; nowhere else could be found
limestone of such whiteness, so easy to cut, or so calculated to lend
itself to the carving of delicate inscriptions and bas-reliefs. The
commoner veins had never ceased to be worked by private enterprise,
gangs of quarrymen being always employed, as at the present day, in
cutting small stone for building purposes, or in ruthlessly chipping it
to pieces to burn for lime in the kilns of the neighbouring villages;
but the finest veins were always kept for State purposes. Contemporary
chroniclers might have formed a very just estimate of national
prosperity by the degree of activity shown in working these royal
preserves; when the amount of stone extracted was lessened, prosperity
was on the wane, and might be pronounced to be at its lowest ebb when
the noise of the quarryman's hammer finally ceased to be heard.

<p>
Every dynasty whose resources were such as to justify their resumption
of the work proudly recorded the fact on stelae which lined
the approaches to the masons' yards. Ahmosis reopened the Tûrah
quarry-chambers, and procured for himself "good stone and white" for the
temples of Anion at Thebes and of Phtah at Memphis. No monument has as
yet been discovered to throw any light on the fate of Memphis subsequent
to the time of the Amenemhâîts. It must have suffered quite as much
as any city of the Delta from the Shepherd invasion, and from the wars
which preceded their expulsion, since it was situated on the highway
of an invading army, and would offer an attraction for pillagers. By a
curious turn of fortune it was the "Fankhûi," or Asiatic prisoners, who
were set to quarry the stone for the restoration of the monuments which
their own forefathers had reduced to ruins.* The bas-reliefs sculptured
on the stelæ of Ahmosis show them in full activity under the <i>corvée;</i>
we see here the stone block detached from the quarry being squared by
the chisel, or transported on a sledge drawn by oxen.
</p>
<pre>
     * The <i>Fankhûi</i> are, properly speaking, all white prisoners,
     without distinction of race. Their name is derived from the
     root <i>fôkhu, fankhu</i> = to bind, press, carry off, steal,
     destroy; if it is sometimes used in the sense of
     Phoenicians, it is only in the Ptolemaic epoch. Here the
     term "Fankhûi" refers to the Shepherds and Asiatics made
     prisoners in the campaign of the year V. against Sharuhana.
</pre>
<p>
Ahmosis had several children by his various wives; six at least owned
Nofrîtari for their mother and possessed near claims to the crown, but
she may have borne him others whose existence is unrecorded. The eldest
appears to have been a son, Sipiri; he received all the honours due to
an hereditary prince, but died without having reigned, and his second
brother, Amenhotpû&mdash;called by the Greeks Amenôthes*&mdash;took his place.
</p>
<pre>
     * The form Amenôphis, which is usually employed, is,
     properly speaking, the equivalent of the name
     <i>Amenemaupitu,</i> or Amenaupîti, which belongs to a king of
     the XXIst Tanite dynasty; the true Greek transcription of
     the Ptolemaic epoch, corresponding to the pronunciation
     <i>Amehotpe,</i> or <i>Amenhopte,</i> is Amenôthes. Under the XVIIIth
     dynasty the cuneiform transcription of the tablets of Tel-el
     Amarna, Amankhatbi, seems to indicate the pronunciation
     Amanhautpi, Amanhatpi, side by side with the pronunciation
     Aman-hautpu, Amenhotpu.
</pre>
<p>
Ahmosis was laid to rest in the chapel which he had prepared for himself
in the cemetery of Drah-abu'l-Neggah, among the modest pyramids of the
XIth, XIIIth, and XVIIth dynasties.* He was venerated as a god, and
his cult was continued for six or eight centuries later, until the
increasing insecurity of the Theban necropolis at last necessitated
the removal of the kings from their funeral chambers.** The coffin of
Ahmosis was found to be still intact, though it was a poorly made one,
shaped to the contours of the body, and smeared over with yellow; it
represents the king with the false beard depending from his chin, and
his breast covered with a pectoral ornament, the features, hair,
and accessories being picked out in blue. His name has been hastily
inscribed in ink on the front of the winding-sheet, and when the lid was
removed, garlands of faded pink flowers were still found about the neck,
laid there as a last offering by the priests who placed the Pharaoh and
his compeers in their secret burying-place.
</p>
<pre>
     * The precise site is at present unknown: we see, however,
     that it was in this place, when wo observe that Ahmosis was
     worshipped by the Servants of the Necropolis, amongst the
     kings and princes of his family who were buried at Drah-
     abu'l-Neggah.

     ** His priests and the minor <i>employés</i> of his cult are
     mentioned on a stele in the museum at Turin, and on a brick
     in the Berlin Museum. He is worshipped as a god, along with
     Osiris, Horus, and Isis, on a stele in the Lyons Museum,
     brought from Abydos: he had, probably, during one of his
     journeys across Egypt, made a donation to the temple of that
     city, on condition that he should be worshipped there for
     ever; for a stele at Marseilles shows him offering homage to
     Osiris in the bark of the god itself, and another stele in
     the Louvre informs us that Pharaoh Thûtmosis IV. several
     times sent one of his messengers to Abydos for the purpose
     of presenting land to Osiris and to his own ancestor
     Ahmosis.

Amenôthes I. had not attained his majority when his father "thus winged
his way to heaven," leaving him as heir to the throne.* Nofrîtari
assumed the authority; after having shared the royal honours for nearly
twenty-five years with her husband, she resolutely refused to resign
them.** She was thus the first of those queens by divine right who,
scorning the inaction of the harem, took on themselves the right to
fulfil the active duties of a sovereign, and claimed the recognition of
the equality or superiority of their titles to those of their husbands
or sons.
</p>
<pre>
     * The last date known is that of the year XXII. at Tûrah;
     Manetho's lists give, in one place, twenty-five years and
     four months after the expulsion; in another, twenty-six
     years in round numbers, as the total duration of his reign,
     which has every appearance of probability.

     ** There is no direct evidence to prove that Amenôthes I.
     was a minor when he came to the throne; still the
     presumptions in favour of this hypothesis, afforded by the
     monuments, are so strong that many historians of ancient
     Egypt have accepted it. Queen Nofrîtari is represented as
     reigning, side by side with her reigning son, on some few
     Theban tombs which can be attributed to their epoch.

The aged Ahhotpu, who, like Nofrîtari, was of pure royal descent, and
who might well have urged her superior rank, had been content to retire
in favour of her children; she lived to the tenth year of her grandson's
reign, respected by all her family, but abstaining from all interference
in political affairs. When at length she passed away, full of days and
honour, she was embalmed with special care, and her body was placed in
a gilded mummy-case, the head of which presented a faithful copy of
her features. Beside her were piled the jewels she had received in her
lifetime from her husband and son. The majority of them a fan with a
handle plated with gold, a mirror of gilt bronze with ebony handle,
bracelets and ankle-rings, some of solid and some of hollow gold, edged
with fine chains of plaited gold wire, others formed of beads of gold,
lapis-lazuli, cornelian, and green felspar, many of them engraved with
the cartouche of Ahmosis. Belonging also to Ahmosis we have a beautiful
quiver, in which figures of the king and the gods stand out in high
relief on a gold plaque, delicately chased with a graving tool; the
background is formed of small pieces of lapis and blue glass, cunningly
cut to fit each other. One bracelet in particular, found on the
queen's wrist, consisted of three parallel bands of solid gold set with
turquoises, and having, a vulture with extended wings on the front. The
queen's hair was held in place by a gold circlet, scarcely as large as
a bracelet; a cartouche was affixed to the circlet, bearing the name of
Ahmosis in blue paste, and flanked by small sphinxes, one on each side,
as supporters. A thick flexible chain of gold was passed several times
round her neck, and attached to it as a pendant was a beautiful scarab,
partly of gold and partly of blue porcelain striped with gold. The
breast ornament was completed by a necklace of several rows of twisted
cords, from which depended antelopes pursued by tigers, sitting
jackals, hawks, vultures, and the winged urasus, all attached to the
winding-sheet by means of a small ring soldered on the back of each
animal. The fastening of this necklace was formed of the heads of two
gold hawks, the details of the heads being worked out in blue enamel.
Both weapons and amulets were found among the jewels, including three
gold flies suspended by a thin chain, nine gold and silver axes, a
lion's head in gold of most minute workmanship, a sceptre of black wood
plated with gold, daggers to defend the deceased from the dangers of the
unseen world, boomerangs of hard wood, and the battle-axe of Ahmosis.
Besides these, there were two boats, one of gold and one of silver,
originally intended for the Pharaoh Kamosû&mdash;models of the skiff in which
his mummy crossed the Nile to reach its last resting-place, and to sail
in the wake of the gods on the western sea.

Nofrîtari thus reigned conjointly with Amenôthes, and even if we have no
record of any act in which she was specially concerned, we know at least
that her rule was a prosperous one, and that her memory was revered by
her subjects. While the majority of queens were relegated after death to
the crowd of shadowy ancestors to whom habitual sacrifice was offered,
the worshippers not knowing even to which sex these royal personages
belonged, the remembrance of Nofrîtari always remained distinct in their
minds, and her cult spread till it might be said to have become a kind
of popular religion. In this veneration Ahmosis was rarely associated
with the queen, but Amenôthes and several of her other children shared
in it&mdash;her son Sipiri, for instance, and her daughters Sîtamon,*
Sîtkamosi, and Marîtamon; Nofrîtari became, in fact, an actual goddess,
taking her place beside Amon, Khonsû, and Maut,** the members of
the Theban Triad, or standing alone as an object of worship for her
devotees.

She was identified with Isis, Hathor, and the mistresses of Hades, and
adopted their attributes, even to the black or blue coloured skin of
these funerary divinities.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Her statue in the Turin Museum represents her as having
     black skin. She is also painted black standing before
     Amenôthes (who is white) in the Deir el-Medineh tomb, now
     preserved in the Berlin Museum, in that of Nibnûtîrû, and hi
     that of Unnofir, at Sheikh Abd el-Qûrnah. Her face is
     painted blue in the tomb of Kasa. The representations of
     this queen with a black skin have caused her to be taken for
     a negress, the daughter of an Ethiopian Pharaoh, or at any
     rate the daughter of a chief of some Nubian tribe; it was
     thought that Ahmosis must have married her to secure the
     help of the negro tribes in his wars, and that it was owing
     to this alliance that he succeeded in expelling the Hyksôs.
     Later discoveries have not confirmed these hypotheses.
     Nofrîtari was most probably an Egyptian of unmixed race, as
     we have seen, and daughter of Ahhotpû I., and the black or
     blue colour of her skin is merely owing to her
     identification with the goddesses of the dead.
</pre>
<p>
Considerable endowments were given for maintaining worship at her tomb,
and were administered by a special class of priests. Her mummy reposed
among those of the princes of her family, in the hiding-place at
Deîr-el-Baharî: it was enclosed in an enormous wooden sarcophagus
covered with linen and stucco, the lower part being shaped to the body,
while the upper part representing the head and arms could be lifted off
in one piece. The shoulders are covered with a network in relief, the
meshes of which are painted blue on a yellow background. The Queen's
hands are crossed over her breast, and clasp the <i>crux ansata</i>, the
symbol of life. The whole mummy-case measures a little over nine feet
from the sole of the feet to the top of the head, which is furthermore
surmounted by a cap, and two long ostrich-feathers. The appearance is
not so much that of a coffin as of one of those enormous caryatides
which we sometimes find adorning the front of a temple.
</p>
<p>
We may perhaps attribute to the influence of Nofrîtari the lack of zest
evinced by Amenôthes for expeditions into Syria. Even the most energetic
kings had always shrunk from penetrating much beyond the isthmus. Those
who ventured so far as to work the mines of Sinai had nevertheless
felt a secret fear of invading Asia proper&mdash;a dread which they never
succeeded in overcoming. When the raids of the Bedouin obliged the
Egyptian sovereign to cross the frontier into their territory, he would
retire as soon as possible, without attempting any permanent conquest.
After the expulsion of the Hyksôs, Ahmosis seemed inclined to pursue a
less timorous course. He made an advance on Sharûhana and pillaged it,
and the booty he brought back ought to have encouraged him to attempt
more important expeditions; but he never returned to this region, and it
would seem that when his first enthusiasm had subsided, he was paralysed
by the same fear which had fallen on his ancestors. Nofrîtari may have
counselled her son not to break through the traditions which his father
had so strictly followed, for Amenôthes I. confined his campaigns to
Africa, and the traditional battle-fields there. He embarked for the
land of Kûsh on the vessel of Ahmosi-si-Abîna "for the purpose of
enlarging the frontiers of Egypt." It was, we may believe, a thoroughly
conventional campaign, conducted according to the strictest precedents
of the XIIth dynasty. The Pharaoh, as might be expected, came into
personal contact with the enemy, and slew their chief with his own
hand; the barbarian warriors sold their lives dearly, but were unable
to protect their country from pillage, the victors carrying off whatever
they could seize&mdash;men, women, and cattle. The pursuit of the enemy had
led the army some distance into the desert, as far as a halting-place
called the "Upper cistern"&mdash;<i>Khnûmît hirît</i>; instead of retracing his
steps to the Nile squadron, and returning slowly by boat, Amenôthes
resolved to take a short cut homewards. Ahmosi conducted him back
overland in two days, and was rewarded for his speed by the gift of
a quantity of gold, and two female slaves. An incursion into Libya
followed quickly on the Ethiopian campaign.

The tribe of the Kihaka, settled between Lake Mareotis and the Oasis of
Amon, had probably attacked in an audacious manner the western provinces
of the Delta; a raid was organized against them, and the issue was
commemorated by a small wooden stele, on which we see the victor
represented as brandishing his sword over a barbarian lying prostrate at
his feet. The exploits of Amenôthes appear to have ended with this raid,
for we possess no monument recording any further victory gained by him.
This, however, has not prevented his contemporaries from celebrating him
as a conquering and 'victorious king. He is portrayed standing erect in
his chariot ready to charge, or as carrying off two barbarians whom he
holds half suffocated in his sinewy arms, or as gleefully smiting the
princes of foreign lands. He acquitted himself of the duties of the
chase as became a true Pharaoh, for we find him depicted in the act of
seizing a lion by the tail and raising him suddenly in mid-air previous
to despatching him. These are, indeed, but conventional pictures of
war, to which we must not attach an undue importance. Egypt had need of
repose in order to recover from the losses it had sustained during the
years of struggle with the invaders. If Amenôthes courted peace from
preference and not from political motives, his own generation profited
as much by his indolence as the preceding one had gained by the energy
of Ahrnosis. The towns in his reign resumed their ordinary life,
agriculture flourished, and commerce again followed its accustomed
routes. Egypt increased its resources, and was thus able to prepare
for future conquest. The taste for building had not as yet sufficiently
developed to become a drain upon the public treasury. We have, however,
records showing that Amenôthes excavated a cavern in the mountain
of Ibrîm in Nubia, dedicated to Satît, one of the goddesses of the
cataract.

It is also stated that he worked regularly the quarries of Silsileh,
but we do not know for what buildings the sandstone thus extracted was
destined.* Karnak was also adorned with chapels, and with at least one
colossus,** while several chambers built of the white limestone of Tûrah
were added to Ombos. Thebes had thus every reason to cherish the memory
of this pacific king.
</p>
<pre>
     * A bas-relief on the western bank of the river represents
     him deified: Panaîti, the name of a superintendent of the
     quarries who lived in his reign, has been preserved in
     several graffiti, while another graffito gives us only the
     protocol of the sovereign, and indicates that the quarries
     were worked in his reign.

     ** The chambers of white limestone are marked I, K, on
     Mariette's plan; it is possible that they may have been
     merely decorated under Thûtmosis III., whose cartouches
     alternate with those of Amenôthes I. The colossus is now in
     front of the third Pylon, and Wiedemann concluded from this
     fact that Amenôthes had begun extensive works for enlarging
     the temple of Amon; Mariette believed, with greater
     probability, that the colossus formerly stood at the
     entrance to the XIIth dynasty temple, but was removed to its
     present position by Thûtmosis III.
</pre>
<p>
As Nofrîtari had been metamorphosed into a form of Isis, Amenôthes was
similarly represented as Osiris, the protector of the Necropolis, and he
was depicted as such with the sombre colour of the funerary divinities;
his image, moreover, together with those of the other gods, was used
to decorate the interiors of coffins, and to protect the mummies of his
devotees.*
</p>
<pre>
     * Wiedemann has collected several examples, to which it
     would be easy to add others. The names of the king are in
     this case constantly accompanied by unusual epithets, which
     are enclosed in one or other of his cartouches: Mons.
     Kevillout, deceived by these unfamiliar forms, has made out
     of one of these variants, on a painted cloth in the Louvre,
     a new Amenôthes, whom he styles Amenôthes V.

One of his statues, now in the Turin Museum, represents him sitting on
his throne in the posture of a king giving audience to his subjects, or
in that of a god receiving the homage of his worshippers. The modelling
of the bust betrays a flexibility of handling which is astonishing in a
work of art so little removed from barbaric times; the head is a marvel
of delicacy and natural grace. We feel that the sculptor has taken a
delight in chiselling the features of his sovereign, and in reproducing
the benevolent and almost dreamy expression which characterised them.*
The cult of Amenôthes lasted for seven or eight centuries, until the
time when his coffin was removed and placed with those of the other
members of his family in the place where it remained concealed until our
own times.**
</p>
<pre>
     * Another statue of very fine workmanship, but mutilated, is
     preserved in the Gizeh Museum; this statue is of the time of
     Seti I., and, as is customary, represents Amenôthes in the
     likeness of the king then reigning.

     ** We know, from the Abbott Papyrus, that the pyramid of
     Amenôthes I. was situated at Dr-ah Abou'l-Neggah, among
     those of the Pharaohs of the XIth, XIIth, and XVIIth
     dynasties. The remains of it have not yet been discovered.
</pre>
<p>
It is shaped to correspond with the form of the human body and painted
white; the face resembles that of his statue, and the eyes of enamel,
touched with kohl, give it a wonderful appearance of animation. The body
is swathed in orange-coloured linen, kept in place by bands of brownish
linen, and is further covered by a mask of wood and cartonnage, painted
to match the exterior of the coffin. Long garlands of faded flowers deck
the mummy from head to foot. A wasp, attracted by their scent, must have
settled upon them at the moment of burial, and become imprisoned by the
lid; the insect has been completely preserved from corruption by the
balsams of the embalmer, and its gauzy wings have passed un-crumpled
through the long centuries.
</p>
<p>
Amenôthes had married Ahhotpû II, his sister by the same father and
mother;* Ahmasi, the daughter born of this union, was given in marriage
to Thûtmosis, one of her brothers, the son of a mere concubine, by name
Sonisonbû.** Ahmasi, like her ancestor Nofrîtari, had therefore the
right to exercise all the royal functions, and she might have claimed
precedence of her husband. Whether from conjugal affection or from
weakness of character, she yielded, however, the priority to Thûtmosis,
and allowed him to assume the sole government.
</p>
<pre>
     * Ahhotpû II. may be seen beside her husband on several
     monuments. The proof that she was full sister of Amenôthes
     I. is furnished by the title of "hereditary princess" which
     is given to her daughter Àhmasi; this princess would not
     have taken precedence of her brother and husband Thûtmosis,
     who was the son of an inferior wife, had she not been the
     daughter of the only legitimate spouse of Amenôthes I. The
     marriage had already taken place before the accession of
     Thûtmosis I., as Ahmasi figures in a document dated the
     first year of his reign.

     ** The absence of any cartouche shows that Sonisonbû did not
     belong to the royal family, and the very form of the name
     points her out to have been of the middle classes, and
     merely a concubine. The accession of her son, however,
     ennobled her, and he represents her as a queen on the walls
     of the temple at Deîr el-Baharî; even then he merely styles
     her "Royal Mother," the only title she could really claim,
     as her inferior position in the harem prevented her from
     using that of "Royal Spouse."

He was crowned at Thebes on the 21st of the third month of Pirît; and
a circular, addressed to the representatives of the ancient seignorial
families and to the officers of the crown, announced the names assumed
by the new sovereign. "This is the royal rescript to announce to you
that my Majesty has arisen king of the two Egypts, on the seat of the
Horus of the living, without equal, for ever, and that my titles are
as follows: The vigorous bull Horus, beloved of Mâît, the Lord of
the Vulture and of the Uraeus who raises itself as a flame, most
valiant,&mdash;the golden Horns, whose years are good and who puts life
into all hearts, king of the two Egypts, Akhopirkerî, son of the Sun,
Thûtmosis, living for ever.* Cause, therefore, sacrifices to be offered
to the gods of the south and of Elephantine,** and hymns to be chanted
for the well-being of the King Akhopirkerî, living for ever, and then
cause the oath to be taken in the name of my Majesty, born of the royal
mother Sonisonbû, who is in good health.&mdash;This is sent to thee that thou
mayest know that the royal house is prosperous, and in good health and
condition, the 1st year, the 21st of the third month of Pirît, the day
of coronation."
</p>
<pre>
     * This is really the protocol of the king, as we find it on
     the monuments, with his two Horus names and his solar
     titles.

     ** The copy of the letter which has come down to us is
     addressed to the commander of Elephantine: hence the mention
     of the gods of that town. The names of the divinities must
     have been altered to suit each district, to which the order
     to offer sacrifices for the prosperity of the new sovereign
     was sent.
</pre>
<p>
The new king was tall in stature, broad-shouldered, well knit, and
capable of enduring the fatigues of war without flagging. His statues
represent him as having a full, round face, long nose, square chin,
rather thick lips, and a smiling but firm expression. Thûtmosis brought
with him on ascending the throne the spirit of the younger generation,
who, born shortly after the deliverance from the Hyksôs, had grown up
in the peaceful days of Amenôthes, and, elated by the easy victories
obtained over the nations of the south, were inspired by ambitions
unknown to the Egyptians of earlier times. To this younger race Africa
no longer offered a sufficiently wide or attractive field; the whole
country was their own as far as the confluence of the two Niles, and the
Theban gods were worshipped at Napata no less devoutly than at Thebes
itself. What remained to be conquered in that direction was scarcely
worth the trouble of reducing to a province or of annexing as a colony;
it comprised a number of tribes hopelessly divided among themselves,
and consequently, in spite of their renowned bravery, without power of
resistance. Light columns of troops, drafted at intervals on either
side of the river, ensured order among the submissive, or despoiled the
refractory of their possessions in cattle, slaves, and precious stones.
Thûtmosis I. had to repress, however, very shortly after his accession,
a revolt of these borderers at the second and third cataracts, but they
were easily overcome in a campaign of a few days' duration, in which the
two Âhmosis of Al-Kab took an honourable part. There was, as usual, an
encounter of the two fleets in the middle of the river: the young king
himself attacked the enemy's chief, pierced him with his first arrow,
and made a considerable number of prisoners. Thûtmosis had the corpse of
the chief suspended as a trophy in front of the royal ship, and sailed
northwards towards Thebes, where, however, he was not destined to
remain long.* An ample field of action presented itself to him in the
north-east, affording scope for great exploits, as profitable as they
were glorious.**
</p>
<pre>
     * That this expedition must be placed at the beginning of
     the king's reign, in his first year, is shown by two facts:
     (1) It precedes the Syrian campaign in the biography of the
     two Âhmosis of El-Kab; (2) the Syrian campaign must have
     ended in the second year of the reign, since Thûtmosis I.,
     on the stele of Tombos which bears that date, gives
     particulars of the course of the Euphrates, and records the
     submission of the countries watered by that river. The date
     of the invasion may be placed between 2300 and 2250 B.C.; if
     we count 661 years for the three dynasties together, as
     Erman proposes, we find that the accession of Ahmosis would
     fall between 1640 and 1590. I should place it provisionally
     in the year 1600, in order not to leave the position of the
     succeeding reigns uncertain; I estimate the possible error
     at about half a century.

     ** It is impossible at present to draw up a correct table of
     the native or foreign sovereigns who reigned over Egypt
     during the time of the Hyksôs. I have given the list of the
     kings of the XIIIth and XIVth dynasties which are known to
     us from the Turin Papyrus. I here append that of the
     Pharaohs of the following dynasties, who are mentioned
     either in the fragments of Manetho or on the monuments:

Syria offered to Egyptian cupidity a virgin prey in its large commercial
towns inhabited by an industrious population, who by maritime trade
and caravan traffic had amassed enormous wealth. The country had been
previously subdued by the Chaldæans, who still exercised an undisputed
influence over it, and it was but natural that the conquerors of the
Hyksôs should act in their turn as invaders. The incursion of Asiatics
into Egypt thus provoked a reaction which issued in an Egyptian invasion
of Asiatic soil. Thûtmosis and his contemporaries had inherited none of
the instinctive fear of penetrating into Syria which influenced Ahmosis
and his successor: the Theban legions were, perhaps, slow to advance,
but once they had trodden the roads of Palestine, they were not likely
to forego the delights of conquest. From that time forward there was
perpetual warfare and pillaging expeditions from the plains of the Blue
Nile to those of the Euphrates, so that scarcely a year passed without
bringing to the city of Amon its tribute of victories and riches gained
at the point of the sword. One day the news would be brought that the
Amorites or the Khâti had taken the field, to be immediately followed by
the announcement that their forces had been shattered against the valour
of the Egyptian battalions. Another day, Pharaoh would re-enter the city
with the flower of his generals and veterans; the chiefs whom he had
taken prisoners, sometimes with his own hand, would be conducted through
the streets, and then led to die at the foot of the altars, while
fantastic processions of richly clothed captives, beasts led by halters,
and slaves bending under the weight of the spoil would stretch in an
endless line behind him.

<p>
Meanwhile the Timihû, roused by some unknown cause, would attack the
outposts stationed on the frontier, or news would come that the Peoples
of the Sea had landed on the western side of the Delta; the Pharaoh had
again to take the field, invariably with the same speedy and successful
issue. The Libyans seemed to fare no better than the Syrians, and before
long those who had survived the defeat would be paraded before the
Theban citizens, previous to being sent to join the Asiatic prisoners
in the mines or quarries; their blue eyes and fair hair showing from
beneath strangely shaped helmets, while their white skins, tall stature,
and tattooed bodies excited for a few hours the interest and mirth of
the idle crowd. At another time, one of the customary raids into the
land of Kûsh would take place, consisting of a rapid march across the
sands of the Ethiopian desert and a cruise along the coasts of Pûanîfc.
This would be followed by another triumphal procession, in which fresh
elements of interest would appear, heralded by flourish of trumpets and
roll of drums: Pharaoh would re-enter the city borne on the shoulders of
his officers, followed by negroes heavily chained, or coupled in such
a way that it was impossible for them to move without grotesque
contortions, while the acclamations of the multitude and the chanting of
the priests would resound from all sides as the <i>cortege</i> passed through
the city gates on its way to the temple of Amon. Egypt, roused as it
were to warlike frenzy, hurled her armies across all her frontiers
simultaneously, and her sudden appearance in the heart of Syria gave a
new turn to human history. The isolation of the kingdoms of the ancient
world was at an end; the conflict of the nations was about to begin.
